- Types of grafts
	- Arterial graft 
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Internal thoracic artery (internal mammary artery)</span>
			- Good accessibility, close proximity to the heart
			- Left thoracic artery is suitable for bridging stenoses in the left anterior descending artery due to their close spatial proximity. 
		- Radial artery: performance modified Allen test before CABG
	- Venous graft (aortocoronary saphenous vein bypass, or ACVB)
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Great saphenous vein</span> (first choice in vein bypass grafts because of good surgical access to the long, superficial leg vein with suitable vessel cross-section)
