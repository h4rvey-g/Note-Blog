## Supervised Learning

[Supervised learning](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/supervised-machine-learning) models are models that map inputs to outputs, and attempt to extrapolate patterns learned in past data on unseen data. Supervised learning models can be either regression models, where we try to predict a continuous variable, like stock prices—or classification models, where we try to predict a binary or multi-class variable, like whether a customer will churn or not. In the section below, we'll explain two popular types of supervised learning models: linear models, and tree-based models.
### Linear Models

In a nutshell, linear models create a best-fit line to predict unseen data. Linear models imply that outputs are a linear combination of features. In this section, we'll specify commonly used linear models in machine learning, their advantages, and disadvantages.

## Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning is about discovering general patterns in data. The most popular example is clustering or segmenting customers and users. This type of segmentation is generalizable and can be applied broadly, such as to documents, companies, and genes. Unsupervised learning consists of clustering models, that learn how to group similar data points together, or association algorithms, that group different data points based on pre-defined rules.
