- Definition: X-linked recessive disease that causes a <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">complete deficiency of mature B lymphocytes</span>
- Epidemiology: occurs mainly in <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">boys</span>
- Etiology: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">defect of Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK)</span> expressed in B cells â†’ complete deficiency of mature B cells
- Clinical features: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Symptoms develop between 3 and 6 months of age when maternal IgG levels in fetal serum start to decrease.</span>
	- Hypoplasia of lymphoid tissue (e.g., tonsils, lymph nodes)
	- Recurrent, severe, pyogenic infections (e.g., pneumonia, otitis media), especially with encapsulated bacteria (S. pneumoniae, N. meningitidis, and H. influenzae)
	- Hepatitis virus and enterovirus (e.g., Coxsackie virus) infections
- Diagnosis
	- Flow cytometry
		- Absent or low levels of B cells (marked by CD19, CD20, and CD21) 
		- Normal or high T cells
	- Low immunoglobulins of all classes
	- Absent lymphoid tissue, i.e., no germinal centers and primary follicles
