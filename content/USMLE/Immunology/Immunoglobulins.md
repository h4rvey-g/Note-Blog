Fab fragments contain a variable domain and the first constant region from a heavy and light chain; because they do not contain an Fc receptor, Fab fragments cannot trigger cell killing via [[Complement system|complement]] or phagocytosis.

![[Pasted image 20241228210712.png|Pasted image 20241228210712.png]]
- IgM
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Blood group antibodies</span>
- IgG
	- The only immunoglobulin that can <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">cross the placenta</span> and thus conveys transient passive immunity to the child
- IgA
	- Found especially on mucosal surfaces and in bodily fluids like saliva, mucus, tears and <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">breast milk </span>
	- Prevents binding of pathogens to mucous membranes of host cells
# Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC)
---
- Definition: an immune response in which <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Fc receptor-bearing immune effector cells (e.g., NK cells, [[eosinophils|eosinophils]]) bind to and lyse target cells that have specific antibodies attached to their surface antigens (pathogen or tumor-derived)</span>
- Characteristics
	- Allows innate immune cells to recognize pathogens that do not express pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)
	- Part of the immune response to parasites
- Effector cells
	- NK cells (most common): interact with IgG-coated target cells and subsequently release cytotoxic substances (perforins, granzymes) 
	- [[Eosinophils|Eosinophils]]: interact with IgE-coated helminths and subsequently release major basic proteins and other cytotoxic substances
	- Other: monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils
- Mechanism![[paste-201824808206876.jpg|paste-201824808206876.jpg]]
	- Binding of antibodies (e.g., IgG or IgE) produced by B-cells to antigens on target cells (e.g., tumor cells, viruses, or parasites)
	- Recognition and binding of the Fc portion of bound IgG or IgE by Fc receptors expressed on the surface of effector cells (e.g., CD16 Fc receptors on NK cells) 
	- Activation of signaling pathways in the effector cell (e.g., NK cell), leading to cytotoxic granule release
	- Destruction of the target cell (e.g., via the perforin/granzyme cell death pathway)
