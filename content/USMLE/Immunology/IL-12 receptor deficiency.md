- Definition: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">impaired Th1 response due to ↓ IL-12 receptors </span>
- Etiology: autosomal recessive
- Pathophysiology
	- Normally, antigen-presenting macrophages release IL-12 → Th cells transformation to T1 type → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">release of [[Interferons and Tumor necrosis factor|IFN-γ]] to activate macrophages</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Defective IL-12 receptors: macrophages cannot be activated by [[Interferons and Tumor necrosis factor|IFN-γ]] → no cytotoxicity in cells infected with intracellular pathogens (e.g., [[Mycobacteria|Mycobacteria]], Salmonella)</span>
	- IL-12 receptor deficiency is the underlying pathology in most cases of high Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial disease (MSMD)
		- Affected individuals have defects in [[Interferons and Tumor necrosis factor|IFN-γ]] mediated immunity.
		- This increases susceptibility to infection with weakly virulent [[mycobacteria|mycobacteria]] (e.g., environmental [[mycobacteria|mycobacteria]], BCG vaccine).
- Clinical features
	- The age of onset varies (depends on the age at exposure to causative pathogens): ∼ 1–3 years of age
	- Features of disseminated disease
