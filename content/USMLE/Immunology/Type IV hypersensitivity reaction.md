# Pathophysiology
Compared to type I-III hypersensitivity reactions, which are antibody-mediated, type IV reactions are mediated by T cells. Type IV hypersensitivity reactions involve two major steps:
1. T cell sensitization: skin penetration by the antigen → uptake of the antigen by Langerhans cell → migration to lymph nodes → formation of sensitized T lymphocytes
2. Presensitized T cell response (after repeated contact with the antigen)
	- CD4+ T cells recognize antigens on antigen-presenting cells → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">release of inflammatory lymphokines cytokines (e.g., IFN-γ, TNF-α)</span> → macrophages activation → phagocytosis of target cells ![[Pasted image 20231217105956.png|Pasted image 20231217105956.png]]
	- CD8+ T cells recognize antigens on somatic cells → cell-mediated cytotoxicity → direct cell destruction

# Examples
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Skin tests</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Candida skin test (to test the immune function of T cells)</span>
		- A diagnostic test in which Candida albicans antigen is injected intradermally to the arm. The injection site is examined 48 hours later. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Induration ≥5 mm in diameter is considered a positive reaction and indicates prior exposure to antigen and an intact immune response mediated by T cells.</span>
		- This test requires patients to have encountered Candida before. Luckily, **nearly everyone** encounters Candida at some point in their lives.
	- Mantoux tuberculin skin test for latent tuberculosis
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Exanthematous drug eruption: morbilliform rash on the trunk and proximal extremities</span> 
	- Associated symptoms include <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">pruritus and low-grade fever</span>![[Pasted image 20241126114848.png|Pasted image 20241126114848.png]]
	- Typical onset 5-14 days after drug exposure
	- Caused by anticonvulsants, antibiotics, antiretroviral therapy
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Most commonly caused by antibiotics, e.g., “ampicillin rash” following ampicillin administration for infectious mononucleosis</span>
	- Resolves after discontinuation of the offending drug
