- Definition: A rare genetic condition caused by numerous genetic mutations that result in the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">defective development of functional B cells and T cells</span>.
- Etiology: various mutations, the most common of which are:
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">X-linked recessive: mutations in the gene encoding the common gamma chain → defective IL-2R gamma chain receptor linked to JAK3 (most common SCID mutation)</span>
	- Autosomal recessive
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[Adenosine deaminase deficiency|Adenosine deaminase deficiency]]</span> → accumulation of toxic metabolites (deoxyadenosine and dATP) and disrupted purine metabolism →<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)"> accumulation of dATP inhibits the function of ribonucleotide reductase → impaired generation of deoxynucleotides</span>
