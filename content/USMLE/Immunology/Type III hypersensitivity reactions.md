- Reactions tend to be systemic, as immune complexes are distributed via circulation throughout the body.
# Pathophysiology
1. Antigen (e.g., the molecules of a drug in circulation) binds to IgG to form an immune complex (antigen-antibody complex) 
2. Immune complexes are deposited in tissue, especially blood vessels → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">initiation of [[Complement system|complement]] cascade → release of lysosomal enzymes from neutrophils → cell death → inflammation → [[Vasculitides|vasculitis]]</span>
# Examples
- [[Vasculitides|Vasculitis]]
	- [[Polyarteritis nodosa|Polyarteritis nodosa]]
	- Drug-induced hypersensitivity [[Vasculitides|vasculitis]]
- Nephropathy
	- [[Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis|Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis]]
- [[Hypersensitivity pneumonitis|Hypersensitivity pneumonitis]] 
- [[Systemic lupus erythematosus|Systemic lupus erythematosus]] (e.g., lupus nephritis, hypertension, thrombosis)
