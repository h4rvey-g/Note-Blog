# Margination
- Definition: a process by which leukocytes are <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">distributed peripherally along the endothelial surface</span>
- Mechanism: The two main mechanisms that allow for margination are rouleaux formation and dilation of post-capillary venules.
# Rolling
- Definition: a transient weak interaction of leukocytes with endothelial cells that causes them to <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">move slowly along the blood vessel periphery in areas of inflammation in preparation for adhesion</span>
- Mechanism: mediated by adhesion molecules (selectins)
	- On endothelial cells
		- P-selectin
			- Stored in Weibel-Palade bodies
			- Histamine-mediated release within the endothelium in response to inflammation
		- E-selectin: released in response to inflammatory mediators such as TNF and IL-1
		- Other: GlyCAM-1, CD34
	- On leukocytes
		- Neutrophils and other leukocytes express Sialyl-LewisX and L-selectin, respectively.
		- Deficiency of the adhesion molecule Sialyl-LewisX causes [[Leukocyte adhesion deficiency type 1|Leukocyte adhesion deficiency type 1]] type 2.
# Leukocyte adhesion
- Definition: the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">firm binding of leukocytes to endothelium prior to migrating out of the vasculature</span>
- Mechanism: mediated by adhesion molecules
	- On endothelial cells
		- Intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM, also called CD54)
		- Vascular adhesion molecule (VCAM, also called CD106)
		- Both upregulated by TNF and IL-1
	- On neutrophils and lymphocytes
		- Neutrophils: [[lymphocyte|lymphocyte]] function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1)
			- Belongs to β2-integrin family
			- Composed of CD18 and CD11a
			- Binds to ICAM
		- Lymphocytes and monocytes β1-integrin (also called VLA-4) binds to VCAM
		- Expression of integrins is activated by <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">leukotriene B4 (LTB4)</span> and C5a. 
		- The deficiency of a CD18 integrin subunit causes [[Leukocyte adhesion deficiency type 1|Leukocyte adhesion deficiency type 1]].

><font color="#ffc000">Selectin</font>s are molecules that allow leukocytes to <font color="#ffc000">select</font> the place of their migration <font color="#ffc000">(weak binding)</font>, while <font color="#ffc000">integrins</font> are molecules that <font color="#ffc000">integrate (strong binding)</font> the leukocytes with the endothelial cells.
# Diapedesis (transmigration)
- Definition: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">the transmigration of leukocytes across endothelial barriers</span> (can occur paracellularly or transcellularly)
- Mechanism
	- Leukocytes leave the blood vessel by moving between endothelial cells.
	- Neutrophils release type IV collagenase, which dissolves the basement membrane and allows them to exit the interstitial space.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Requires expression of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1, also called CD31)</span>, an endothelial cell adhesion molecule (ECAM) on neutrophils, endothelial cells, and platelets
# Migration
- Definition: the process by which <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">leukocytes travel through the interstitium to the site of inflammation after leaving the blood vessels</span>
- Mechanism: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Occurs via chemotaxis, which is mediated by chemoattractants</span>
	- Leukotrienes: e.g., LTB4
	- Platelet-activating factor (PAF)
	- Chemokines: e.g., IL-8
	- Kallikrein: a serine protease enzyme that activates bradykinin and regulates blood pressure
	- [[Complement system|Complement]] fragments, e.g., C5a
