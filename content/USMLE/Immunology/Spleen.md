## Red pulp
Red pulp is composed of splenic cords and sinuses (sinusoids). 
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Splenic cords: a reticular meshwork filled with blood (open circulation system) that filters the blood from damaged erythrocytes</span>
- Spleen sinusoids: long vessels with a fenestrated ring-like (“barrel hoop”) basement membrane that <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">prevent old or malformed RBCs/platelets from reentering venous circulation</span>
	- Open circulation: Blood empties from sheathed capillaries into the splenic cords and then enters the sinusoids through slits in the vessel wall.
	- Closed circulation: Blood empties from sheathed capillaries of the red pulp directly into the sinusoids.![[Pasted image 20241104104700.png|Pasted image 20241104104700.png]]
- Macrophages: found in the cords and around the sinusoids
	- Phagocytosis of damaged RBCs/platelets that do not reenter circulation 
	- Capture of viruses and opsonized pathogens that enter the red pulp
- Blood flow: splenic artery → arterioles → red pulp (cords → sinusoids) → venules → splenic vein → portal circulation
## White pulp
- Periarteriolar lymphatic sheath
	- Surrounds the arterioles
	- Dense lymphoid tissue containing T lymphocytes
- Splenic follicles
	- Main component of white pulp
	- Close to periarteriolar lymphatic sheath
	- Contain B lymphocytes
- Splenic marginal zone
	- Located between the red pulp and white pulp
	- Contains antigen-presenting cells (APCs): macrophages and specialized B cells (marginal zone B cells)
