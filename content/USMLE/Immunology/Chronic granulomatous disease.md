# Diagnostics
- Neutrophil assay
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Dihydrorhodamine test (DHR): flow cytometry test showing abnormal NADPH oxidase activity</span> (inability to metabolize dihydrorhodamine to fluorescent product, rhodamine → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">decreased green fluorescence</span>)
		- The DHR assay detects the conversion of DHR (a colorless substance) to rhodamine (fluoresces green) by free radicals produced when the NADPH oxidase pathway is stimulated (eg, by a protein kinase C agonist such as phorbol myristate acetate).  In unaffected patients, stimulated cells show increased intensity of fluorescence (ie, rightward shift along the x-axis), indicating appropriate NADPH activity, whereas unstimulated cells remain colorless.  In patients with CGD, the stimulated cells show no increased fluorescence (ie, no oxidation of DHR).![[highresdefault_L77221.png|highresdefault_L77221.png]]

# Treatment
- Life-long prophylactic [[antibiotics|antibiotics]], e.g., TMP-SMX (for catalase-positive infections)
- [[Interferons and Tumor necrosis factor|IFN-γ]] therapy
- Bone marrow transplant
