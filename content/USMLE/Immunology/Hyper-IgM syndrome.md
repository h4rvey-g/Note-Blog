- Definition: A group of syndromes characterized by impaired interaction between Th cells and B cells that results in a B cell class-switching defect
- Epidemiology: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">CD40 ligand deficiency</span> is the most common form.
- Etiology
	- X-linked recessive inheritance
	- CD40L deficiency in Th cells leads to abnormal interaction with B cells that express the CD40 receptor, disrupting B-cell class-switching, which leads to depleted [[immunoglobulins|immunoglobulins]] 
		- Because CD40L is required for B-cells to undergo <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">class-switching</span>, mutations to CD40L generally cause B cells to overproduce IgM and dramatically underproduce other immunoglobulin classes (IgA, IgE, IgG)
- Clinical features
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Recurrent severe pyogenic infections that manifest since childhood</span>
		- Opportunistic <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">sinopulmonary infections (commonly Pneumocystis jirovecii and Histoplasma)</span>
		- Cryptosporidium enteritis (which may lead to biliary disease, [[cirrhosis|cirrhosis]], and cholangiocarcinoma)
		- CMV hepatitis
	- Failure to thrive
- Diagnosis
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↓ IgG, IgA, IgE</span>
	- Normal or <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↑ IgM</span>
	- Lymph node biopsy: absent germinal centers
