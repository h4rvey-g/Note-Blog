# Mycophenolate mofetil
- Reversible inhibition of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase → blockade of purine synthesis → selective inhibition of [[lymphocyte|lymphocyte]] proliferation
- Indications
	- [[Diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis|Lupus nephritis]]
	- Used in combination with cyclosporin or tacrolimus as [[transplant rejection|transplant rejection]] prophylaxis
	- Rheumatic diseases (glucocorticoid sparing)
- Adverse effects
	- Infection (especially with [[Cytomegalovirus infection|CMV]])
	- Vomiting and diarrhea
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hyperglycemia</span>
	- [[Hypertension|Hypertension]]
# Calcineurin inhibitors
calcineurin = calcium- and calmodulin-dependent serine-threonine phosphatase
- Physiologically, calcineurin activates the nuclear factor of <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">activated T cell</span> (NFAT) by dephosphorylating its serine-threonine residues. Activated NFAT binds to DNA and <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">enables transcription of a number of cytokines (most prominently, IL-2) and other molecules (e.g., VEGF). Transcription of IL-2 ultimately leads to activation of Th2, CD8 and NK cells.</span>
- Agents
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Cyclosporine A, Tacrolimus</span> (also FK-506 or fujimycin), Pimecrolimus
		- Tacrolimus: immunosuppressant macrolide from Tsukuba
# Glucocorticoids
- Mechanism of action
	- Inhibition of intracellular NF-κB → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">inhibition of multiple inflammatory and immune mediators (e.g., cytokines) → suppression of B cells and T cells function</span>
	- Long-term effects (in hours) → direct influence on gene expression
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Increased apoptosis of [[eosinophils|eosinophils]], T cells, and monocytes, perhaps by decreasing Bcl-2 expression</span>
# Immune checkpoint inhibitors
---
A medication that inhibits the action of regulatory proteins, known as checkpoint proteins, on the immune response. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Checkpoint inhibitors are used in the treatment of cancers which produce checkpoint proteins that reduce a patient's intrinsic antineoplastic T-cell activity.</span>
