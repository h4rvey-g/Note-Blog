- Neutropenia: ANC < 500/mcL OR expected to decrease to < 500/mcL within 48 hours

# Etiology
---
- Low ANC: typically results from cancer therapy
- Source of fever: neutropenic fever without an identifiable source (eg, normal chest x-ray, normal urine culture, normal examination) is believed to be caused by <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">translocation of endogenous bacteria into the bloodstream from mucositis, which results from chemotherapy-induced disruption of the gastrointestinal epithelium. </span>
