- Definition: genetic condition characterized by <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">impaired function of T cells and thrombocytopenia</span>
- Epidemiology: occurs primarily in males
- Etiology: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">mutated WAS gene (X-linked recessive inheritance) → impaired signaling to actin cytoskeleton reorganization → defective antigen presentation</span>
- Clinical features
	- Onset of symptoms: from birth
	- Classic triad
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Purpura (bleeding diathesis)</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Eczema (high risk of atopic disorders)</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Recurrent opportunistic infections with encapsulated organisms</span> in the first years of life (e.g., otitis media)
	- Increased risk of autoimmune diseases and hematological malignancies (e.g., lymphoma, leukemia)

- Diagnosis
	- Normal or ↓ IgG and IgM
	- ↑ IgE and IgA
