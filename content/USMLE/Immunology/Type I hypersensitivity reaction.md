# Etiology


---
# Pathophysiology
- When a <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">multivalent antigen comes in contact with the cell, multiple IgE antibodies become cross-linked, resulting in aggregation of the FcÎµRI receptors on the mast cell surface.</span> ![[highresdefault_L23794.jpg|highresdefault_L23794.jpg]]
- This clumping of receptors leads to the activation of non-receptor tyrosine kinases, triggering an intracellular cascade that ultimately results in mast cell and basophil degranulation.

# Clinical features

# Diagnostics
## Hypersensitivity blood tests (in vitro)
- Tryptase
	- A relatively specific marker of mast cell activation
	- Elevated levels indicate an increased risk of severe reactions.
