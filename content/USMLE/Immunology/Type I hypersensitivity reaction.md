# Etiology

# Pathophysiology
- When a <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">multivalent antigen comes in contact with the cell, multiple IgE antibodies become cross-linked, resulting in aggregation of the FcÎµRI receptors on the mast cell surface.</span> ![[highresdefault_L23794.jpg|highresdefault_L23794.jpg]]
- This clumping of receptors leads to the activation of non-receptor tyrosine kinases, triggering an intracellular cascade that ultimately results in mast cell and basophil degranulation.
## Timing
- After first exposure to an allergen (eg, peanuts), antigen specific IgE is produced by B-cells and binds to the surface of mast cells.  If repeat exposure occurs, the bound IgE can cross-link and stimulate the release of preformed histamine and leukotrienes that cause vasodilation and increased capillary permeability.  <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">The result is a rapid (eg, minutes after exposure) early-phase type I hypersensitivity response characterized by superficial dermal edema and erythema (eg, wheal and flare reaction) that can progress to a more systemic response (eg, anaphylaxis)</span>.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">IgE also initiates the late phase</span> of a type I hypersensitivity reaction <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">by stimulating type 2 helper T cells to release cytokines (eg, IL-5) that activate eosinophils.</span>  Cationic proteins (eg, major basic protein, eosinophil peroxidase) released from eosinophils cause tissue damage, which usually manifests as a <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">palpable, indurated lesion 2-10 hours following the early-phase reaction.</span>![[highresdefault_L58489.jpg|highresdefault_L58489.jpg]]

# Clinical features

# Diagnostics
## Hypersensitivity blood tests (in vitro)
- Tryptase
	- A relatively specific marker of mast cell activation
	- Elevated levels indicate an increased risk of severe reactions.
