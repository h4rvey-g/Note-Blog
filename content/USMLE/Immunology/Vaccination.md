# Inactivated vaccines
## Polysaccharide-based
- Characteristics
	- Bacterial cell wall polysaccharide
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Conjugate polysaccharide vaccine is linked to a protein </span>
- Available vaccines
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hib (conjugate vaccine) </span>
		- conjugated to an immunogenic protein, such as <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">diphtheria toxoid</span>.
	- Pneumococcal vaccine
		- PCV13 (conjugate vaccine)
		- PPSV23 (unconjugated vaccine)
	- Meningococcal vaccine (conjugate vaccine; various strains of Neisseria meningitidis)
- Mechanism of action
	- Polysaccharides induce a relative T cell-independent B-cell response and therefore achieve sufficient immunization only in adults and older children. 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">In conjugate vaccines, the carrier protein activates T-cells, which stimulate a more rapid and long-lasting immune response, especially in infants and toddlers.</span>
