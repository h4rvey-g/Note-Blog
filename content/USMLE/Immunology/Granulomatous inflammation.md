- Antigen-presenting cells present antigens to CD4+ Th cells and secrete IL-12 → stimulation of Th cell differentiation into Th1 cells
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Th1 cells activate macrophages by secreting [[Interferons|IFN-γ]]</span> → cytokine release from macrophages (e.g., TNF) → formation of epithelioid macrophages and giant cells
- Epithelioid cells secrete TNF-α, which serves to maintain the granuloma. 
	- This is the reason why anti-TNF therapy can promote sequestration of granulomas and cause disseminated disease.
	- Therefore, every individual considered for anti-TNF therapy has to be tested for latent [[Tuberculosis|TB]] beforehand.
- Macrophages within the granuloma cause ↑ calcitriol activation due to ↑ 1α-hydroxylase activity → [[hypercalcemia|hypercalcemia]]
