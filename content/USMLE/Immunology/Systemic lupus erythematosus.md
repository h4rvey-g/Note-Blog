# Epidemiology
- Women: 15–44 years

---
# Etiology
- Genetic predisposition
	- HLA-DR2 and [[HLA system|HLA-DR3]] are commonly present in individuals with SLE.
	- Genetic deficiency of classical pathway [[Complement system|complement]] proteins (C1q, C2, C4) in approx. 10% of affected individuals
- Hormonal factors: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hyperestrogenic states (e.g., due to oral contraceptive use, postmenopausal hormonal therapy</span>, [[endometriosis|endometriosis]]) are associated with an increased risk of SLE.
- Environmental factors
	- Cigarette smoking and silica exposure increase the risk of developing SLE.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">UV light and [[Infectious mononucleosis|EBV]] infection may trigger disease flares</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Ultraviolet rays and sun exposure lead to increased cell apoptosis</span>
	- Drugs such as procainamide or hydralazine (see “[[Drug-induced lupus erythematosus|Drug-induced lupus erythematosus]]”)

# Pathophysiology
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Autoantibody development: deficiency of classical [[Complement system|complement]] proteins (C1q, C4, C2) → failure of macrophages to phagocytose immune complexes and apoptotic cell material (i.e., plasma and nuclear antigens) → dysregulated, intolerant lymphocytes targeting normally hidden intracellular antigens → autoantibody production (e.g., ANA, anti-dsDNA) </span>
	- Normally, apoptotic cells are engulfed by macrophages during apoptosis, avoiding the release of intracellular content that induces inflammation or an immune response in the extracellular environment.
- Autoimmune reactions
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Type III hypersensitivity (most common in SLE) → antibody-antigen complex formation in microvasculature → [[Complement system|complement]] activation and inflammation → damage to skin, kidneys, joints, small vessels</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Type II hypersensitivity → IgG and IgM antibodies directed against antigens on cells (e.g., red blood cells) → cytopenia</span>

	- Periungual telangiectasia

## Laboratory studies
![[Pasted image 20240116151535.png|Pasted image 20240116151535.png]]
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Antinuclear antibodies (ANAs)</span>
	- Positive titers of ≥ 1:80 have <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">∼ 98% sensitivity for SLE</span>
- Antigen-specific ANAs: Request only if ANAs are positive.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Anti-dsDNA antibodies</span>
		- Autoantibodies against double-stranded DNA
		- Positive in 60–70% of patients
		- Highly specific for SLE
		- Levels correlate with disease activity (especially [[Diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis|lupus nephritis]] activity). 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Anti-Sm antibodies</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Autoantibodies against Smith antigens (nonhistone nuclear proteins)</span>
			- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Smith can bond to snRNAs to form snRNPs, which can form a spliceosome.</span>
		- Positive in < 30% of patients, but highly specific for SLE
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Antiphospholipid antibodies: Screen all patients for [[antiphospholipid syndrome|antiphospholipid syndrome]].</span>
- Laboratory markers of disease activity and/or organ damage in SLE
	- [[Complement system|Complement]] levels: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↓ C3 and/or ↓ C4 in patients with active disease, factor B levels remain normal </span>![[Pasted image 20240224215441.png|Pasted image 20240224215441.png]]
		- Antigen-antibody complexes trigger classic pathway, which decreases C3 and C4. But factor B in alternative pathway is intact.
