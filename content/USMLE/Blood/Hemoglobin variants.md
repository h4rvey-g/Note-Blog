- HbF: has <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">significantly higher oxygen affinity</span> than adult hemoglobin A.  This allows fetal hemoglobin to <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">extract more oxygen from the mother's adult hemoglobin in the placenta</span>, providing the developing fetus with an adequate supply of oxygen.
- HbS: Point mutation in the β-globin gene resulting in the replacement of glutamic acid by valine
- HbC: Point mutation in the β-globin gene resulting in the replacement of glutamic acid by lysine
