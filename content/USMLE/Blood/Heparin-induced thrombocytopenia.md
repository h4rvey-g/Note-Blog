Formerly called type 2 HIT
# Epidemiology
---


# Etiology
---
>[!tip] 
>Heparin treatment, especially with unfractionated heparin (UFH), often causes thrombocytopenia. For this reason, a baseline check and regular monitoring of platelet counts are required.

# Pathophysiology
---
![[L42334.jpg|L42334.jpg]]
- Heparin and platelet factor 4 (PF4) form a complex → production of IgG antibodies against the heparin/PF4 complex → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">IgG antibody-heparin/PF4 immunocomplex binds on platelet surface → platelet activation and aggregation</span> → consumption of platelets (thrombocytopenia) and arterial/venous thrombosis
- Thrombocytopenia also occurs due to phagocytosis of IgG antibody-heparin/PF4 immunocomplex-bound platelets by macrophages in the spleen, liver, and bone marrow.

# Clinical features
---
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">HIT is primarily a prothrombotic disorder</span>, with venous and/or arterial thrombosis developing in 25–50% of affected patients.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Venous thrombosis occurs most frequently</span>; manifestations include:
	- Calf swelling and pain from lower extremity DVT
- Arterial thrombosis occurs less commonly
- Localized skin necrosis at heparin injection sites
>[!tip] 
>HIT more commonly manifests with symptoms of thrombosis than with bleeding

# Diagnostics


# Differential diagnostics
---
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Nonimmune heparin-associated thrombocytopenia (formerly called type 1 HIT)</span>
	- A <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">transient and clinically insignificant</span> mild to moderate thrombocytopenia, usually occurring within 5 days of heparin initiation
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Caused by a direct effect of heparin on platelet activation</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Not associated with an increased risk of thrombosis</span>
# Treatment
---
## Empirical management of HIT
- Stop all heparin exposure immediately (including heparin flushes and heparin-coated catheters).
- Patients on [[vitamin K|vitamin K]] antagonists (e.g., warfarin): Stop the medication and consider reversal with [[vitamin K|vitamin K]]. 
- Initiate nonheparin anticoagulation
