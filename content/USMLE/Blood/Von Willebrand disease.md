# Epidemiology
---
Most common congenital bleeding disorder.
# Etiology
---
## Acquired von Willebrand disease (aVWD)
- Lymphoproliferative and myeloproliferative diseases (e.g., [[multiple myeloma|multiple myeloma]], monoclonal gammopathies, lymphoma, essential thrombocythemia)
- Autoimmune diseases (e.g., [[Systemic lupus erythematosus|SLE]])
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Cardiovascular defects (e.g., [[ventricular septal defect|ventricular septal defect]], [[Aortic valve stenosis|aortic stenosis]]) </span>
	- These conditions lead to <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">increased shear stress</span> in blood vessel which can result in <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">increased degradation of vWF</span>.

- Side effects of certain drugs (e.g., valproic acid)
# Pathophysiology
---
- Von Willebrand factor (vWF): plasma protein that is synthesized by and stored in endothelial cells (in Weibel-Palade bodies) and platelets (in α-granules)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Mediates platelet adhesion and aggregation</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Binds factor VIII (and thereby prevents its degradation)</span>

Deficiency or dysfunction of vWF leads to:![[Pasted image 20240209102217.png|Pasted image 20240209102217.png]]
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Dysfunctional platelet adhesion → impaired primary hemostasis</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Reduced binding of factor VIII → increased degradation → ↓ factor VIII activity → impaired intrinsic pathway of secondary hemostasis</span>
# Diagnostics
- ↑ Bleeding time
- Normal or ↑ aPTT (may be prolonged as a result of factor VIII deficiency)
- Ristocetin cofactor assay: measures the ability of von Willebrand factor (vWF) to agglutinate platelets.
	- Ristocetin is an antibiotic that activates vWF to bind glycoprotein Ib, thereby inducing platelet aggregation.
	- Interpretation: If ristocetin is added to blood lacking vWF (or the vWF receptor), platelets will not aggregate.
# Treatment
---
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Desmopressin (DDAVP): stimulates vWF release from endothelial cells</span>
	- Best initial treatment for mild or moderate symptoms (typically type 1 and, sometimes, type 2)
	- Not effective for type 3 
- Concentrates containing vWF and factor VIII: indicated for severe bleeding, as prophylaxis for surgical procedures and if DDAVP treatment is ineffective
