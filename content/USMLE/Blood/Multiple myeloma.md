- Neoplastic proliferation of plasma cells
	- Bone marrow infiltration by malignant plasma cells → suppression of hematopoiesis → leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Cell proliferation → pro-osteoclastogenic factors (e.g., TNF-α, IL-1, RANK-L) → osteolytic lesions → [[hypercalcemia|hypercalcemia]]</span>
- Overproduction of monoclonal immunoglobulin and/or light chains → dysproteinemia (a state of pathologically increased synthesis of [[immunoglobulins|immunoglobulins]] and/or their subunits) → kidney damage (e.g., myeloma cast nephropathy) and/or paraprotein tissue deposition (may cause [[amyloidosis|amyloidosis]]) 
	- Nonfunctioning antibodies → functional antibody deficiency
	- ↑ Serum viscosity → hyperviscosity syndrome

>[!warning] 
>[[Hypercalcemia|Hypercalcemia]] in MM is nor related to [[Parathyroid hormone-related protein|PTHrP]]!
# Clinical features
---
- Often asymptomatic
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Bone pain, especially [[back pain|back pain]] (most common symptom)</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Symptoms of [[hypercalcemia|hypercalcemia]], e.g. constipation</span>
- Foamy urine (caused by Bence Jones proteins in urine)

# Diagnostics
---
- Calcium > 11 mg/dL or > 1 mg/dL above the ULN
- Renal insufficiency: GFR < 40 mL/min or serum creatinine > 2 mg/dL 
- [[Anemia|Anemia]]: Hb < 10 g/dL or more than 2 g/dL below the LLN
	- Normocytic anemia
- Bone lesions: ≥ 1 osteolytic lesions on imaging
## Bone marrow biopsy
- Cytology: clusters of plasma cells ![[L44127.jpg|L44127.jpg]]
	- Mildly organized monoclonal cells
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Perinuclear lucent zone</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Clockface nuclei: Chromatin in the periphery of the nucleus resembles a cartwheel or clock face arrangement.</span>
	- Intracytoplasmic crystalline inclusion bodies containing IgG

# Complications
---
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Myeloma cast nephropathy (i.e., myeloma kidney): most common cause of renal injury and renal failure in patients with multiple myeloma</span>
	- Clinical features: oliguria, peripheral edema, dyspnea
	- Pathophysiology: excessive production and filtration of light chains into the urine → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">precipitation of light chains</span> in renal tubules → tubular obstruction
	- Diagnosis: markedly positive urine sulfosalicylic acid test  and/or urine protein electrophoresis
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">On light microscopy, numerous large, glassy eosinophilic [[Urine sediment|casts]] are seen.</span>
	- May progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD)
