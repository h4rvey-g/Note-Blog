# Epidemiology

# Etiology
---
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Exclusive breastfeeding: low vitamin K levels in breast milk (most important in late-onset VKDB)</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Vitamin K deficiency in the mother (e.g., because of anticonvulsant therapy; most important in early-onset VKDB; maternal malnutrition)</span>
- Underdeveloped intestinal flora (which produces vitamin K), e.g., due to premature birth
- Long-term antibiotic treatment in newborns 
## Classification
- Early onset: within 24 hours after birth; intracranial bleeding common
- Classic: within 1 week after birth; intracranial bleeding rare
- Late onset: between 2–8 months after birth; intracranial bleeding common

- Umbilical, mucosal & gastrointestinal bleeding
