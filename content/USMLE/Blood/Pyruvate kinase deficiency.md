- Etiology: autosomal recessive defect of pyruvate kinase
- Pathophysiology
	- Glucose is the only energy source in RBCs
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Pyruvate kinase catalyzes the last step of [[glycolysis|glycolysis]] (i.e., irreversibly converts phosphoenolpyruvate into pyruvate)</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Absence of pyruvate kinase → ATP deficiency in RBC</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">ATP deficiency disrupts the cation gradient along the RBC membrane → rigid RBCs → ↑ hemolysis (extravascular)</span>
	- Accumulation of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate → ↑ release of O2 from Hb → masks symptoms of anemia
- Clinical symptoms
	- Seldom asymptomatic 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Typically newborn jaundice due to hemolysis and history of exchange transfusions</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[Splenomegaly|Splenomegaly]]</span>
	- Pallor, fatigue, weakness
	- In rare cases: hydrops fetalis
- Diagnosis
	- ↓ Pyruvate kinase enzyme activity
	- PKLR gene mutation
	- Blood smear: burr cells
- Therapy
	- Phototherapy and/or exchange transfusions
	- In the case of severe anemia or excessively enlarged spleen: splenectomy
