# VitB12 deficiency
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">In neurologic symptoms caused by [[vitamin B12|vitamin B12]] deficiency, both homocysteine and methylmalonic acid levels are increased.</mark> Measurement of these metabolites has been shown to be more sensitive in diagnosing [[vitamin B12|vitamin B12]] deficiency than measuring serum B12 levels alone . Elevated methylmalonic acid levels indicate a deficiency in [[vitamin B12|vitamin B12]], as <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">methylmalonic acid reacts with [[vitamin B12|vitamin B12]] to produce coenzyme A, which is essential for normal cellular function</mark> . Homocysteine levels also increase due to [[vitamin B12|vitamin B12]] deficiency, as <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">[[vitamin B12|vitamin B12]] is necessary for the metabolism of homocysteine .</mark> These metabolites can serve as early markers for tissue [[vitamin B12|vitamin B12]] deficiency, even before hematologic manifestations occur .
