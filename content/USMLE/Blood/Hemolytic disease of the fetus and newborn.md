## ABO incompatibility
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Highest risk: mother with blood group O; newborn with blood group A or B</span>
- Maternal antibodies (anti-A and/or anti-B) against nonself antigens of the ABO system are present even if sensitization has not occurred, so fetal hemolysis may occur <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">during the first pregnancy</span>.
	- Combination of predominantly IgM antibodies and late expression of fetal ABO antigens reduces the chances of significant disease.
