# Etiology
- Primary ITP: idiopathic (most common) 
- Secondary ITP associated with:
	- Autoimmune disorders: [[Systemic lupus erythematosus|SLE]], [[Antiphospholipid syndrome|Antiphospholipid syndrome]]
	- Malignancy: lymphoma, leukemia (particularly CLL)
	- Infection: HIV, HCV
	- Drugs: e.g., quinine, beta-lactam antibiotics, carbamazepine, heparin, vaccines, linezolid, sulfonamides, vancomycin, TMP-SMX, antiepileptics

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">The acute form is typically seen in children after a viral disease.</span>
# Pathophysiology
Antiplatelet antibodies (mostly IgG directed against, e.g., GpIIb/IIIa, GpIb/IX) bind to surface proteins on platelets → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">sequestration by spleen and liver</span> → ↓ platelet count → bone marrow megakaryocytes and platelet production increase in response (in most cases).
# Clinical features
- Mostly asymptomatic.<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)"> [[Splenomegaly|Splenomegaly]] is very unusual in ITP and makes other diagnoses more likely! </span>
	- Although platelets can undergo splenic sequestration in ITP, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">the primary mechanism responsible for the thrombocytopenia is immune destruction.</span>
