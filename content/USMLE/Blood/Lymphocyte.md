# Lymphocytosis
Lymphocytosis: > 33%
## Etiology
- Acute viral infections (e.g., [[rubella|rubella]], [[infectious mononucleosis|infectious mononucleosis]], [[mumps|mumps]])
- Chronic infections (e.g., <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[tuberculosis|tuberculosis]]</span>, syphilis, toxoplasmosis)
- Neoplasia (e.g., [[Hodgkin lymphoma|Hodgkin lymphoma]], [[Non-Hodgkin lymphomas|non-Hodgkin lymphoma]], CLL)

1. APC ingests and processes antigen, then migrates to the draining lymph node.
2. T-cell activation (signal 1): <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">exogenous antigen is presented on MHC II and recognized by TCR on Th (CD4+) cell. Endogenous or cross-presented antigen is presented on MHC I to Tc (CD8+) cell.</span>
3. Proliferation and survival (signal 2): <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">costimulatory signal via interaction of B7 protein (CD80/86) on dendritic cell and CD28 on naïve T cell.</span>
	- Antigen presentation without this co-stimulatory signal will lead to T-cell anergy:
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Important self-tolerance mechanism</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">The cell will not be activated even though it is exposed to its antigen</span>
	- Superantigens (e.g., toxic shock syndrome toxin 1, enterotoxin B) link MHC II antigen-presenting cells and T-cell receptors on T cells and lead to activation of T cells without a costimulatory signal.
4. Activated Th cell produces cytokines. Tc cell able to recognize and kill virus-infected cell.

## T-cell development
- Positive selection of T cells: ensures that the thymus produces functional T cells
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Location: thymic cortex</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Thymic cortical cells express MHC class I and MHC class II antigens.</span>
	- Tests if T-cell receptors can bind to MHC appropriately (<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">not too strongly or too weakly</span>)
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">T cells (CD4+/CD8+, double-positive thymocytes) receive survival signal.</span>
		- Dysfunctional T cells then undergo apoptosis.
- Negative selection of T cells: ensures that the thymus does not produce self-reacting T cells
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Location: thymic medulla</span>
	- Tests if T cells bind to <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">tissue-restricted self-antigens presented on MHC by thymic medullary cells</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">T cells that do not bind receive survival signal.</span>
		- T cells that bind self-antigens undergo apoptosis, except for a few that become regulatory T cells.
	- Self-antigen presentation is mediated by the autoimmune regulator protein (AIRE protein), dysfunction of which can lead to:
		- Adrenal insufficiency
		- Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis
		- Hypoparathyroidism
## T-cell subtypes
### Cytotoxic T cells (killer T cells)
- Surface markers: CD8
- Function: Important component of cell-mediated immunity; recognize and kill cells infected with intracellular pathogens (especially viruses) and neoplastic cells; interact with foreign antigens presented via MHC I; induce apoptosis or cell lysis of presenting cells
- Stimulated by: Macrophages
- Clinical significance: HIV, Hepatitis B, Adult T cell lymphoma
### T-helper cells (Th cells)
#### Th1 cells
- Surface markers: CD4, CD40L
- Function: Promote cellular immune response; fight <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">intracellular pathogens</span>
- Stimulate: Macrophages, Cytotoxic T cells, NK cells, B cells (leading to IgG production)
- Clinical significance: Infections with intracellular pathogens (e.g., Mycobacteria, Salmonella), IL-12 receptor deficiency, Type I diabetes, Rheumatoid arthritis, Multiple sclerosis
#### Th2 cells
- Function: Initiate <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">humoral immune response</span> in cooperation with B lymphocytes; fight <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">extracellular pathogens</span> (especially parasites)
- Stimulate: Eosinophils, Mast cells, Basophils, B cells (leading to IgE production)

## B-cell activation and class switching
![[Pasted image 20241230145031.png|Pasted image 20241230145031.png]]
1. Th-cell activation as above.
2. B-cell receptor–mediated endocytosis.
	- B lymphocytes recognize antigens via their B-cell receptors (membrane‑bound immunoglobulins, IgD or IgM) → B cell receptor-mediated endocytosis of the BCR/antigen complex → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">breakdown of antigen into small fragments by lysosomal proteases → presentation of antigen fragment via MHC class II receptors on B cell surface to Th cells plus costimulation of B cell CD40 receptor by Th cell CD40L</span> → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">T cell‑dependent activation of B cells (plasma cells)</span> → immunoglobulin production
	- B cell and T cell need to be <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">activated by the same antigen</span>
1. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Exogenous antigen is presented on MHC II and recognized by TCR on Th cell.</span>
2. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">CD40 receptor on B cell binds CD40 ligand (CD40L) on Th cell.</span>
3. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Th cells secrete cytokines that determine Ig class switching of B cells.</span>
4. B cells are activated and produce IgM. They undergo class switching and affinity maturation.
