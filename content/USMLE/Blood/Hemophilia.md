# Etiology
Hemophilia usually affects males, as it is primarily an <mark style="background: #FFF3A34A;">X-linked recessive</mark> disease.
- Hemophilia A (factor VIII deficiency): ∼ 80% of cases
- Hemophilia B (factor IX deficiency): ∼ 20% of cases
- Hemophilia C (factor XI deficiency): very rare
# Clinical features
1. Repeated hemarthrosis (e.g., knee joint) → hemophilic arthropathy (i.e., destruction of the joint due to repeated hemarthrosis)
2. Oral mucosa bleeding, [[epistaxis|epistaxis]], excessive bleeding following small procedures (e.g., dentist procedures)
3. Hemophilia C does not typically manifest with spontaneous bleeding, hemarthrosis, or deep tissue bleeding.
