Description: any MPN leading to <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">bone marrow fibrosis, extramedullary hematopoiesis, and [[splenomegaly|splenomegaly]]</span>
# Epidemiology
Peak incidence is between <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">50 and 74 years of age.</span>

# Etiology


---
# Pathophysiology
Genetic mutations → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">hyperplasia of atypical megakaryocytes</span> → ↑ TGF-β → ↑ fibroblast activity → bone marrow obliteration due to fibrosis → displacement of hematopoietic stem cells → extramedullary hematopoiesis

# Clinical features
- Constitutional symptoms
- [[Anemia|Anemia]]
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Symptomatic [[splenomegaly|splenomegaly]]</span>
- Thromboembolic events 
	- Due to thrombocytosis and leukocytosis in the prefibrotic proliferative phase
- Petechial bleeding 
- Increased infections 

>[!tip] Myelofibrosis vs [[Aplastic anemia|Aplastic anemia]]
>- Myelofibrosis: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[splenomegaly|splenomegaly]]</span>
>	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Evidence of extra medullary hematopoesis</span>
>- [[Aplastic anemia|Aplastic anemia]]: no
>- Explanation: In myeloproliferative disorders like myelofibrosis, niche in marrow is disturbed by slow fibrosis of marrow so <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">stem cells migrate and extra medullary haematopoiesis occurs</span>. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">But in aplastic anemia</span> (whether primary or secondary to drugs etc) <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">stem cells themselves are destroyed or affected so haematopoiesis not possible anywhere.</span> So we don't get hepatosplenomegaly and other evidences of extramedullary haematopoiesis.

# Diagnostics
- CBC
	- Classic presentation: [[anemia|anemia]], thrombocytosis, and leukocytosis
	- Patients may additionally present with:
		- Thrombocytopenia (33%) 
		- [[Pancytopenia|Pancytopenia]] (10%)
- ↑ [[Leukocyte alkaline phosphatase|Leukocyte alkaline phosphatase]], LDH
- Peripheral blood smear: dacrocytes (teardrop cells)
- JAK2 mutation
- Bone marrow studies
	- Aspiration often fails (dry tap) because of severe marrow fibrosis.
