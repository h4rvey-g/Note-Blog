# Etiology
- The JAK2 (Janus kinase 2) oncogene codes for a <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">non-receptor tyrosine kinase</span> in hematopoietic progenitor cells. JAK2 is essential for the regulation of erythropoiesis, thrombopoiesis (megakaryopoiesis), and granulopoiesis. 
- 98% of patients with polcythemia vera have a <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">mutation in the JAK2 gene (gain of function) </span>→ <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↑ tyrosine kinase activity → erythropoietin-independent proliferation of the myeloid cell lines → ↑ blood cell mass (erythrocytosis, thrombocytosis, and granulocytosis) → hyperviscosity and slow blood flow → ↑ risk of thrombosis and poor oxygenation.</span>

# Clinical features
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Pruritus: Itching typically worsens when the skin comes into contact with warm water (aquagenic pruritus).</span>
- Complications
	- Venous thrombosis
	- Arterial thrombosis
	- Hemorrhagic complications

# Diagnostics
>[!tip] 
>Erythrocytosis associated with normal oxygen saturation and decreased serum EPO levels is strongly suggestive of polycythemia vera.

1. **Absolute versus relative erythrocytosis**:  <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hemoglobin and hematocrit levels cannot accurately differentiate these conditions.  Direct measurement of the RBC mass is necessary.  An increased total RBC mass indicates an absolute erythrocytosis; a normal RBC mass indicates a relative erythrocytosis.</span>
	- Estimated using ⁵¹Cr-tagged red blood cell, similar to _Mark_ and _recapture_ method
2. **Primary versus secondary erythrocytosis**:  Serum erythropoietin levels can be used to differentiate primary from secondary erythrocytosis.  Primary erythrocytosis is associated with low erythropoietin levels and is caused by [[Myeloproliferative neoplasms|myeloproliferative disorders]] such as polycythemia vera.  Secondary erythrocytosis is characterized by increased erythropoietin levels due to chronic hypoxia from high altitudes, smoking, or [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]]; or abnormal secretion by neoplastic or otherwise diseased tissues.
3. **Hypoxic versus other causes of secondary erythrocytosis**:  Measurement of the arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) is important to exclude hypoxemia as a cause of the erythrocytosis.  SaO2 < 92% (PaO2 < 65 mm Hg) can cause secondary polycythemia.  SaO2 (measured as a percentage) should not be confused with PaO2 (measured as a partial pressure in mm Hg).
