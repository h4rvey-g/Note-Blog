# Epidemiology
- Age of onset: individuals > 40 years
	- Symptoms start to show when body iron levels reach > 20 g. 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Before [[menopause|menopause]], women lose iron via menstruation and pregnancy, which slows down iron accumulation within the body. As a result, symptom onset occurs later in women (typically postmenopausal) than in men.</span>

# Etiology

# Pathophysiology
HFE gene defect (homozygous) → defective binding of transferrin to its receptor → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↓ hepcidin synthesis by the liver → unregulated ferroportin activity in enterocytes → ↑ intestinal iron [[absorption|absorption]]</span> → iron accumulation throughout the body → damage to the affected organs![[Pasted image 20231029090123.png|Pasted image 20231029090123.png]]

# Diagnostics
- Liver biopsy
	- Hemosiderin (normally golden yellow on microscopy) appears <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">blue with the Prussian blue stain. </span>
	- Pattern of hereditary hemochromatosis: pronounced parenchymal siderosis (accumulation of hemosiderin within the tissue) in hepatocytes and bile duct epithelium
	- Pattern of secondary iron overload: Kupffer cells (specialized macrophages) containing hemosiderin

# Treatment
## Iron chelation therapy
- First-line treatment for <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">secondary iron overload</span> due to iron-loading anemia
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Chelating agents: deferoxamine</span>
