# Epidemiology
---
Mainly children < 5 years of age

# Etiology
---
- Bacterial exotoxins
	- Shiga-like toxin (verotoxin)
		- From enterohemorrhagic E. coli (<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">EHEC</span>) strain O157:H7 
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Usually transmitted via contaminated foods (e.g., undercooked beef or raw leafy vegetables)</span>
	- Shiga toxin produced by Shigella dysenteriae
- [[Streptococcus pneumoniae|Streptococcus pneumoniae]] infection 

# Pathophysiology
---
HUS is a thrombotic microangiopathy, a condition characterized by the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">formation of microthrombi occluding the microvasculature.</span>
1. Infection with enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) or another causative organism
2. Mucosal inflammation facilitates bacterial toxins entering systemic circulation.
	- Most commonly <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Shiga-like toxin</span> from enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) strain O157:H7
3. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Toxins cause endothelial cell damage</span> (<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">especially in the glomerulus</span> ).
4. Damaged endothelial cells secrete cytokines that promote vasoconstriction and platelet microthrombus formation at the site of damage (intravascular coagulopathy) → thrombocytopenia (consumption of platelets)
5. RBCs are mechanically destroyed as they pass through the platelet microthrombi occluding small blood vessels (i.e., arterioles, capillaries) → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">hemolysis (schistocytes), and end-organ ischemia and damage, especially in the kidneys → decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR)</span>
