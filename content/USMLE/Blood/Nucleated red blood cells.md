Nucleated red blood cells (NRBCs) are immature red blood cells not normally seen in the peripheral blood beyond the neonatal period. NRBCs provide a measure of erythropoietic activity. Increased NRBCs can occur during acute haemolytic episodes and severe hypoxic stress, or as a result of a haematological malignancy.
