# Anaphylactic [[transfusion|transfusion]] reaction
- Pathophysiology
	- [[Type I hypersensitivity reaction|Type I hypersensitivity reaction]] in which <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">preformed IgE antibodies on the surface of mast cells bind to donor plasma proteins (commonly donor IgA in recipients with [[Selective IgA deficiency|IgA deficiency]])</span>, leading to mast cell degranulation
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Individuals with [[Selective IgA deficiency|IgA deficiency]] should receive IgA-depleted blood products.</span>
- Clinical features: Sudden onset during or up to 3 hours after the transfusion
	- Shock, hypotension, wheezing, respiratory distress
	- Skin reactions (e.g., pruritus, urticaria)
# Delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction

## Pathophysiology
- Occurs in patients who were <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">previously sensitized to specific RBC antigens</span> during transfusions, pregnancy, or transplantations 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Particularly common in patients receiving repeated transfusions, such as patients with [[sickle cell disease|sickle cell disease]] or [[thalassemia|thalassemia]].</span>
- Usually caused by <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">alloantibodies that form following exposure to minor blood group antigens (e.g., Kidd or D (Rh) antigens) </span>
- Reexposure to the RBC antigens → anamnestic response resulting in an increase in anti-RBC alloantibody titers <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">24 hours to 28 days following transfusion</span> → binding of alloantibodies to donor RBCs causing [[Lab findings of hemolysis|extravascular hemolysis]]
## Clinical features 
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Onset days or weeks after transfusion (due to the delay in the anamnestic response) </span>
- Most commonly asymptomatic
- May cause:
	- Mild fever
	- Jaundice
	- Anemia
# Massive transfusion-related complications
## <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hypocalcemia</span>
- Resulting from the binding of ionized calcium by citrate (an anticoagulant added to RBC, platelet, FFP, and whole blood transfusion units)
## Hyperkalemia
- Resulting from the lysis of RBCs in stored blood units
