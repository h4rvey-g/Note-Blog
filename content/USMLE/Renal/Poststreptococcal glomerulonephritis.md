# Epidemiology
<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Bimodal age distribution; mostly affects children (between the ages of 3–12 years) and patients > 60 years of age</span>

---
# Etiology
- Prior infection with group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (GAS, S pyogenes)
	- In children
		- Infection of the mouth and pharynx (tonsillitis, pharyngitis): PSGN typically arises 1–2 weeks following infection.
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Soft tissue infections (erysipelas, impetigo): PSGN typically arises 4–6 weeks following infection.</span>

# Pathophysiology
Infection with nephritogenic strains of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci → streptococcal antigen deposit within the glomerular basement membrane → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">immune complexes formation ([[Type III hypersensitivity reactions|Type III hypersensitivity reaction]])</span> → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[Complement system|complement]] activation</span> (↑ consumption of [[Complement system|complement]] factors) → destruction of the glomeruli → immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis and [[nephritic syndrome|nephritic syndrome]]

# Clinical features
Approx. 50% of patients remain asymptomatic. Symptoms occur approximately 1–6 weeks following an acute infection.
- [[Nephritic syndrome|Nephritic syndrome]]
	- Hematuria:<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)"> tea- or cola-colored urine</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hypertension: can lead to [[headaches|headaches]]</span>
	- Edema (prominent facial edema) 
	- Oliguria
- [[Influenza|Influenza]]-like symptoms 
- Flank pain

# Diagnostics
## Initial evaluation
- Urinalysis with microscopy: nephritic sediment
- C3 [[Complement system|complement]], C4 [[Complement system|complement]] levels: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">classically shows ↓ C3 [[Complement system|complement]] with normal C4 [[Complement system|complement]]</span>
>[!tip] 
>If both C3 and C4 [[Complement system|complement]] levels are decreased, consider other causes of glomerulonephritis with low serum [[Complement system|complement]] levels and possible nonrenal causes of low [[Complement system|complement]] levels (e.g., liver failure, nonrenal protein-losing conditions).

## Evidence of preceding GAS infection
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Antistreptococcal antibody titers</span>
	- Findings: ↑ ASO, ↑ anti-DNase B antibodies
- Isolation of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci
	- Pharyngitis: rapid strep test, throat culture
	- Skin lesions: wound cultures

# Prognosis
---
<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Increased age is the most important poor prognostic factor</span>
- Recovery usually occurs within 6–8 weeks.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">In children: restitution of kidney function in > 90% of cases</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">In adults, about 50% of patients suffer from persistently reduced renal function.</span>
