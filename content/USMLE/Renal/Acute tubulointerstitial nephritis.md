# Definition
Acute tubulointerstitial nephritis (ATIN) is an acute inflammation of the renal interstitium and tubules that causes a decline in renal function over a period of days to weeks.

# Etiology
<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Medications (most common)</span>
- Antibiotics: β-lactams, sulfonamides, rifampin, fluoroquinolones
- [[Non-opioid analgesics|NSAIDs]]
- [[Proton pump inhibitors|Proton pump inhibitors]] and H2 blockers
- Loop diuretics and [[thiazides|thiazides]]
- [[Anticonvulsant drugs|Anticonvulsants]]: phenytoin, [[Anticonvulsant drugs|valproate]], carbamazepine, phenobarbital
- Other: allopurinol

# Pathophysiology
- Immune-mediated tubulointerstitial damage (<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">allergic interstitial nephritis</span>) is the most widely accepted theory.
	- Inflammatory infiltrates → tissue edema and tubular cell damage → compromised tubular flow
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Allergic interstitial nephritis: drugs act as haptens → [[type IV hypersensitivity reaction|type IV hypersensitivity reaction]] </span>
- Acute obstruction: crystals (from e.g., uric acid, medications) or proteins (e.g., light chains) obstruct tubules

# Clinical features
Clinical features of [[acute kidney injury|acute kidney injury]], with or without:
- Morbilliform rash
- Fever
- Arthralgias
- Flank pain
>[!tip] 
>The classic triad of fever, morbilliform rash, and eosinophilia is present in < 10% of patients with ATIN, but their presence can help to guide the diagnosis.

# Diagnostics
- Blood tests 
	- BMP: ↑ BUN and creatinine
	- CBC: ↑ eosinophils (more common in drug-induced ATIN) 
- Urine studies
	- Urinalysis
		- Sterile pyuria
		- Subnephrotic-range proteinuria
	- Microscopic hematuria
		- Urine microscopy
		- WBC casts , RBC casts , waxy casts , granular casts , tubular epithelial casts
		- Urine eosinophils (low sensitivity and specificity for ATIN)

>[!tip] 
>Although frequently cited as a diagnostic clue, in clinical practice, urine eosinophils lack sensitivity and specificity for reliably confirming ATIN.
