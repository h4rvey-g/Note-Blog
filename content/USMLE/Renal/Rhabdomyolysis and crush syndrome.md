- Traumatic
	- Crush injury
	- Direct injury
- Nontraumatic
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[Seizures and epilepsy|Seizures]]</span>
	- Overexertion (e.g., strenuous exercise)
	- Intoxication (e.g., cocaine, heroin, amphetamines, [[MDMA|MDMA]], alcohol, carbon monoxide, phencyclidine)
	- Skeletal muscle ischemia
	- Infection
	- [[Adverse drug reactions|Adverse drug reactions]] (e.g., neuroleptics, [[Lipid-lowering agents|statins]])

# Pathophysiology
---
- Rhabdomyolysis → release of the following substances:
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and serum myoglobin → pigment nephropathy → [[Acute kidney injury|acute tubular necrosis]] → [[acute kidney injury|acute kidney injury]] (intrinsic)</span>
	- Potassium → cardiac arrhythmia
	- Lactic acid → metabolic acidosis
- Hypovolemia → ↓ renal perfusion → [[acute kidney injury|acute kidney injury]] (prerenal)
	- Hypovolemia is predominantly due to third spacing of extracellular fluid into damaged muscle tissue.
- Reperfusion syndrome → compartment syndrome
