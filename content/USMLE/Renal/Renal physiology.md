# The nephron
![[L60470.png|L60470.png]]
>[!tip] 
>- **Iso-osmotic reabsorption:** The proximal tubule reabsorbs sodium and water in equal proportions. This means that while a large amount of sodium is reabsorbed, the concentration in the tubular fluid remains relatively constant.
>- **Active and passive transport:** Sodium reabsorption is driven by active transport mechanisms, primarily the Na+/K+ ATPase pump. This creates an electrochemical gradient that drives the reabsorption of other solutes, including water. Potassium is reabsorbed both passively and actively.
>- **Regulation:** Hormonal mechanisms, such as aldosterone, can fine-tune sodium reabsorption in later parts of the nephron (distal tubule and collecting duct), but in the proximal tubule, the focus is on bulk reabsorption.
## Proximal convoluted tubule (PCT)
1. Bicarbonate
	1. Don't change H<sup>+</sup>, only absorb HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>![[Pasted image 20230829151420.png|Pasted image 20230829151420.png]]
	2. Absorb Na<sup>+</sup> to absorb H<sub>2</sub>O. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">65% of sodium and water are absorbed in PCT</span>.
	3. Angiotensin II increases Na<sup>+</sup>, HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, and H<sub>2</sub>O reabsorption via Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger stimulation (allows for contraction alkalosis).
2. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Parathormone (PTH) decreases PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> reabsorption via Na<sup>+</sup>-PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> cotransporter inhibition.</span>
3. Brush border resorption of most of the ultrafiltrate
	- Glucose (via SGLT2)
	- Amino acids
	- Uric acid
	- Na<sup>+</sup>, Cl<sup>-</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>, and H<sub>2</sub>O<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)"> (All together with Na<sup>+</sup> !!!)</span>![[Pasted image 20230829152436.png|Pasted image 20230829152436.png]]
## Thick ascending loop of Henle
1. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">ADH stimulates the activity of Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-2Cl<sup>-</sup> cotransporter</span>. Increased NKCC2 activity aids in water reabsorption in the collecting duct through aquaporin 2 channels by creating a hypo-osmotic filtrate.
## Distal convoluted tubule (DCT)
1. Magnesium and Calcium are reabsorbed paracellularly.
2. Ca<sup>2+</sup> is reabsorbed using Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels on the luminal surface and Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> antiporters (exchangers) on the basolateral surface.![[Pasted image 20230829155253.png|Pasted image 20230829155253.png]]
	1. PTH up-regulates the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup> antiporter resulting in increased reabsorption of Ca<sup>2+</sup>.
## Collecting duct
1. Principal cells
	2. When acted upon by ADH, principal cells will increase the number of aquaporins (water channels) on the luminal membrane → increased H<sub>2</sub>O reabsorption.![[Pasted image 20230829161022.png|Pasted image 20230829161022.png]]
	3. When acted upon by aldosterone, principal cells increase activity of Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> exchangers → increased Na<sup>+</sup> reabsorption and increased K<sup>+</sup> secretion.
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Water follows sodium through the water channels. So aldosterone won't affect the [[urine osmolality|urine osmolality]]. </span>
2. Alpha-intercalated cells
	1. Have a K<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger on the luminal surface to secrete H<sup>+</sup> and reabsorb K<sup>+</sup>
	2. Have a H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase which actively secretes H<sup>+</sup>. On the basolateral surface, the cells have a HCO3 -/Cl<sup>-</sup> exchanger to reabsorb HCO3 -.
	3. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Aldosterone upregulates H<sup>+</sup> secretion via H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase. Increased H<sup>+</sup> secretion will lead to increased HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> reabsorption.</span>![[Pasted image 20230829160412.png|Pasted image 20230829160412.png]]
3. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">ADH also stimulates reabsorption of urea in collecting ducts to maximize corticopapillary osmotic gradient. **So increased [[BUN-creatinine ratio|BUN-creatinine ratio]] in hypovolemia.**</span>
	- Urea passively diffuses from the interstitium into the loop of Henle, increasing the luminal concentration of urea.![[Pasted image 20240322222015.png|Pasted image 20240322222015.png]]

## Tubuloglomerular feedback
- Description: feedback system between the tubules and glomeruli that <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">adjusts the GFR according to the resorption capacity of the tubules</span>
- Mechanism: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">macula densa (of the juxtaglomerular apparatus) senses alterations in the NaCl concentration in the DCT </span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hypotonic urine (↓ intraluminal Cl<sup>-</sup> concentration) → vasodilation of afferent arterioles → ↑ GFR → ↑ Cl<sup>-</sup> intraluminal concentration → ↑ RBF</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hypertonic urine (↑ intraluminal Cl<sup>-</sup> concentration) → adenosine secretion  → vasoconstriction of afferent arterioles → ↓ capillary pressure → ↓ GFR → ↓ intraluminal Cl<sup>-</sup> concentration → ↓ RBF</span>
## Juxtaglomerular complex
![[L4947.jpg|L4947.jpg]]
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Juxtaglomerular cells</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Modified smooth muscle cells located in the afferent arterioles</span>
	- Function: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">renin synthesis </span>
- Macula densa 
	- Composed of tall cuboidal cells located at the distal end of the thick ascending loop of Henle
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Monitors the NaCl concentration</span> within the lumen of the DCT
		- Hypoosmolar urine  triggers the release of renin → vasoconstriction of the efferent arteriole → increase in GFR
		- Hyperosmolar urine  triggers the release of adenosine → vasoconstriction of the afferent arteriole → decrease in GFR 
- Extraglomerular mesangial cells 
	- Play a role in <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">autoregulation of blood flow</span> to the kidney (exact functioning is not entirely understood)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Form a network of cells, connecting the sensory cells of the macula densa with juxtaglomerular effector cells</span> 
	- May also signal to contractile glomerular mesangial cells and, thereby, directly affect vasoconstriction

## Filtration fraction
- Description: the fraction of the renal plasma flow (RPF) that is filtered from the capillaries into the Bowman space
- Mechanism
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">FF = GFR/RPF (i.e., FF = C<sub>Inulin</sub>/C<sub>PAH</sub>)</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">GFR</span> can be calculated using the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">inulin or creatinine clearance, as these substances are freely filtered at the glomerulus and have relatively insignificant tubular reabsorption or secretion.</span>  <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">RPF</span> can be determined using the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">para-aminohippuric acid (PAH) clearance as almost all the PAH entering the kidneys is excreted in the urine (mostly via tubular secretion).</span>
		- C<sub>Inulin</sub> = inulin clearance
		- C<sub>PAH</sub> = PAH clearance
	- Normal: 20%
	- Regulated via:
		- Prostaglandins → dilation of afferent arterioles → ↑ GFR and ↑ RPF (FF unchanged)
		- Angiotensin II → constriction of efferent arterioles → ↑ GFR and ↓ RPF → ↑ FF

3. Metanephros: the third embryonic excretory organ, developing caudally to the mesonephros and persisting as the permanent kidney
	- Arises during the 5th week of embryonic development
	- Canalization is complete by the 10th week of embryonic development.
	- Maturing of the kidneys continues until week 35–36 of embryonic development.
	- Components
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Ureteric bud (metanephric diverticulum)</span>
			- Originates from the caudal end of the mesonephric duct
			- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Differentiates into the collecting duct system: ureter, renal pelvis, major calyces, minor calyces, and collecting ducts</span>
			- Ureteropelvic junction: junction between ureter and renal pelvis
				- Canalizes last and represents the most common site of prenatal urinary tract obstruction
				- Obstruction of the ureteropelvic junction may cause prenatal hydronephrosis, which can be discovered during prenatal ultrasound screenings.
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Metanephric blastema (metanephric mesenchyme)</span>
			- Differentiation stimulated by ureteric bud signals
			- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Differentiates into nephrons: glomerulus, proximal convoluted tubule, loop of Henle, and distal convoluted tubule </span>
	- Congenital anomalies of the kidneys can result from, e.g., due to abnormal interaction between the ureteric bud and the metanephritic blastema.

![[Pasted image 20241024171043.png|Pasted image 20241024171043.png]]
- Renal cortex
	- The outermost layer of the renal parenchyma (∼ 10 mm thick)
	- Surrounds the renal medulla and extends inwards (as renal columns) dividing the medulla into renal pyramids
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Contains the glomeruli, proximal convoluted tubules, distal convoluted tubules, and cortical collecting ducts</span>
- Renal medulla
	- Consists of several renal medullary pyramids separated by the renal columns 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">The base of each pyramid faces the outer cortex, the apex faces the renal sinus and forms a renal papilla, which drains into a minor calyx.</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Contains the loops of Henle and collecting ducts</span>, which merge to form the papillary ducts at the renal papillae
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Blood flow in the renal medulla is relatively low</span> compared to that in the renal cortex. 
		- Facilitates the development of an osmolality gradient that allows for effective urine concentration 
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Causes medullary vulnerability to hypoxia when renal blood flow is decreased (renal ischemia) </span>
- Renal sinus
	- The inner portion of the kidney containing the renal calyces and renal pelvis
	- The minor calyces draining from each renal papilla merge to form major calyces.
	- The major calyces merge to form the renal pelvis, which represents the proximal portion of the ureter.
- Renal hilum: The medial fissure on each kidney where the renal pelvis, vessels, and nerves enter and exit
