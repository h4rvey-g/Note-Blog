# Etiology
- IgA nephropathy is the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">most common primary [[Nephritic syndrome|glomerulonephritis]] in adults.</span>
- Peak incidence: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">20-30 years old</span>

# Pathophysiology
<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">An increased number of defective, circulating IgA antibodies are synthesized</span> <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">(often triggered by mucosal infections, i.e., upper respiratory tract and gastrointestinal infections)</span> → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">IgA antibodies form immune complexes that deposit in the renal mesangium</span> → mesangial cell and [[complement system|complement system]] activation → [[Nephritic syndrome|glomerulonephritis]] (<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[Type III hypersensitivity reactions|type III hypersensitivity reaction]]</span>)

# Clinical features
- Recurring episodes of:
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Gross or microscopic hematuria</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Flank pain</span>
	- Low-grade fever
	- And/or [[nephritic syndrome|nephritic syndrome]] (including hypertension)
	- Usually during or immediately following a respiratory or gastrointestinal infection
- Can progress to [[Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis|RPGN]] and/or [[nephrotic syndrome|nephrotic syndrome]] (< 10% of patients)
- Up to 50% of patients progress to end-stage renal disease within 20–25 years.

>[!tip] 
>IgA nephropathy and [[IgA vasculitis|IgA vasculitis]] are both IgA-mediated [[vasculitides|vasculitides]] triggered by a mucosal infection. [[IgA vasculitis|IgA vasculitis]] most commonly occurs in children < 10 years of age and affects multiple organ systems (palpable purpura, abdominal pain, arthralgia). IgA nephropathy is limited to the kidneys and typically affects adults.

# Diagnostics
- Laboratory tests
	- Serum IgA level is elevated in 50% of patients.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[Complement system|Complement]] levels (e.g., C3 level) are generally normal.</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Because IgA has weak [[Complement system|complement]]-fixing activity. IgA is mainly in mucosa, where excessive inflammation needs to be avoided.</span>

 >[!tip] 
><span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">C3 levels help rule out [[poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis|poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis]], [[membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis|membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis]], and [[Diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis|lupus nephritis]].</span>
- Renal biopsy
	- Light microscopy: mesangial proliferation![[Pasted image 20230818161650.png|Pasted image 20230818161650.png]]
	- Immunofluorescent microscopy: mesangial IgA deposits
	- Electron microscopy: mesangial immune complex deposits
# Differential diagnosis

>[!tip] 
>1. IgA nephropathy typically occurs <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">immediately following or during a mucosal infection</span> (e.g., upper respiratory tract and gastrointestinal infections), <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">not several weeks after a skin infection in [[Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis|PSGN]]</span>. 
>2. Most patients also have flank pain and a low-grade fever, which are absent in [[Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis|PSGN]].
>3. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Reoccurrence is common in IgA nephropathy, while it's rare in [[Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis|PSGN]].</span>
