# Epidemiology
- Age of symptom onset: childhood

---
# Etiology


---
# Pathophysiology
Structural alteration in the ENaC subunits → inability of these subunits to bind with an intracellular ubiquitin-protein ligase (Nedd4) → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">decreased degradation of ENaC</span> channels by ubiquitin proteasomes → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">increased number of ENaCs in the collecting duct → increased reuptake of water and sodium (pseudohyperaldosteronism) → [[hypertension|hypertension]] with low renin production and [[hypokalemia|hypokalemia]]</span>

# Clinical features
- [[Hypertension|Hypertension]]
>[!tip] 
>The clinical features of Liddle syndrome are similar to those of [[Primary hyperaldosteronism|hyperaldosteronism]], except that Liddle syndrome manifests with decreased renin and aldosterone levels!


---
# Diagnostics
- [[Hypokalemia|Hypokalemia]]
- Metabolic alkalosis

---
# Treatment
Lifelong oral potassium substitution with potassium-sparing [[diuretics|diuretics]] that directly block ENaCs in the collecting duct (e.g., amiloride, triamterene)
>[!warning] 
>The potassium-sparing [[Diuretics|diuretic]] spironolactone (an aldosterone receptor antagonist) is not effective in Liddle syndrome because the increased sodium channel activity is not caused by aldosterone.
