Urinary tract cancer most commonly involves the bladder, although it may also occur in the renal pelvis, ureters, and, rarely, the urethra.
# Epidemiology
- Cancer sites
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Bladder (90%) </span>
	- Renal pelvis and renal calyces (8%)
	- Ureter  and urethra (2%)
 - Histological types
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Transitional cell (urothelial) carcinoma</span>: most common (∼ 95%) type of cancer of the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">bladder, ureter, renal pelvis, and proximal urethra in <font color="#ffc000">male</font> individuals</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Squamous cell carcinoma</span>: most common (∼ 60%) type of cancer of the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">distal urethra in <font color="#ffc000">male</font> individuals and the entire urethra in <font color="#ffc000">female</font> individuals</span>
# Risk factors
# Transitional cell urothelial carcinoma
- Carcinogens
	- Tobacco (esp. due to 2-naphthylamine in cigarette smoke)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Aromatic amines</span> (e.g., benzidine, aniline dye, azo dye, arylamines)
	- Medications
		- Cyclophosphamide
		- Phenacetin 
		- High-dose, long-term pioglitazone treatment [11]
	- Heavy metals (e.g., chlorine and [[Arsenic toxicity|arsenic]] content in drinking water)

# Pathology
- Papillary urothelial carcinoma
	- A thick papilla with a fibrovascular core![[Pasted image 20230819151707.png|Pasted image 20230819151707.png]]
- Squamous cell carcinoma
	- Chronic inflammatory stimuli (e.g., [[schistosomiasis|schistosomiasis]], chronic cystitis) can lead to transformation of urothelial cells into squamous epithelial cells (squamous metaplasia)
