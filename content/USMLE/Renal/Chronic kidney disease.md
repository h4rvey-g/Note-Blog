## Consequences
### Reduced GFR
- ↓ Production of urine → ↑ extracellular fluid volume → total-body volume overload
- ↓ Excretion of waste products (e.g., urea, drugs)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↓ Excretion of phosphate → hyperphosphatemia</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">During the early stages of CKD</span>, plasma phosphate levels will typically be normal due to the increased secretion of <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23).</span>  
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">FGF23 is produced by osteoblasts in response to initial hyperphosphatemia and increased calcitriol.</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Increased secretion of FGF23 leads to increased phosphate secretion and suppressed conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D.</span>
		- In advanced CKD, the effects of FGF 23 subside (most likely due to development of resistance in target tissues).
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↓ Maintenance of acid-base balance  → metabolic acidosis</span>
- ↓ Maintenance of electrolyte concentrations → electrolyte imbalances (e.g., Na<sup>+</sup> retention)
### Reduced endocrine activity
- ↓ Hydroxylation of calcifediol → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↓ production of calcitriol → (in combination with ↓ excretion of phosphate) → ↓ serum Ca<sup>2+</sup> → ↑ PTH</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↓ Erythropoietin → ↓ stimulation of erythropoiesis</span>

# Clinical features
---
## Manifestations of uremia
- Definition: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Uremia is defined as the accumulation of toxic substances due to decreased renal excretion.</span> These toxic substances are mostly metabolites of proteins such as urea, creatinine, β2 microglobulin, and parathyroid hormone.
- Constitutional symptoms
	- Fatigue
	- Weakness
	- [[Headaches|Headaches]]
- Gastrointestinal symptoms
	- Nausea and vomiting
	- Loss of appetite
	- Uremic fetor: characteristic ammonia- or urine-like breath odor
- Dermatological manifestations
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Pruritus</span> 
		- Accumulation of histamine
	- Skin color changes (e.g., hyperpigmentation, pallor due to anemia)
	- Uremic frost: uremia leads to high levels of urea secreted in the sweat, the evaporation of which may result in tiny crystallized yellow-white urea deposits on the skin. 
- Serositis
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Uremic pericarditis</span>: a complication of chronic kidney disease that causes [[fibrinous pericarditis|fibrinous pericarditis]]  
		- Clinical features: chest pain worsened by inhalation
		- Physical examination findings
			- Friction rub on auscultation
			- ECG changes normally seen in nonuremic pericarditis (e.g., diffuse ST-segment elevation) are not usually seen. 
	- Pleuritis
- Neurological symptoms
	- Asterixis
	- Signs of uremic encephalopathy
		- Seizures
		- Somnolence
		- Coma
	- Peripheral neuropathy → paresthesias
- Hematologic symptoms
	- Anemia
	- Leukocyte dysfunction → ↑ risk of infection
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↑ Bleeding tendency caused by abnormal platelet adhesion and aggregation</span>![[highresdefault_L82381.png|highresdefault_L82381.png]]
		- See [[Urea cycle|Urea cycle]]
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Normal platelet count, PT, aPTT; ↑ bleeding time</span>
