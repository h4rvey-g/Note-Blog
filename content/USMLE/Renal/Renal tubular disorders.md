# Renal tubular acidosis (RTA)

- In RTA, there is a <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">normal anion gap metabolic acidosis</span> in patients with normal or almost normal renal function.
- Basically all present with low pH and hypokalemia (except type 4)
	- Think H<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> antagonize each other during excretion (due to Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> vs Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup>), increased excretion of one leads to decreased excretion of the other.
- Renal tubular acidosis is <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">caused by defects in the tubular transport of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and/or H<sup>+</sup>.</span>
- Most forms of RTA are asymptomatic; rarely, life-threatening electrolyte imbalances may occur.

## [[Proximal renal tubular acidosis (type 2)|Proximal renal tubular acidosis (type 2)]]
- Isolated proximal RTA: The proximal convoluted tubule cells are unable to reabsorb HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>.
- Fanconi syndrome: Impaired reabsorption of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">and other compounds (e.g., potassium, glucose, phosphate, and amino acid reabsorption)</span> in the PCT
## [[Distal renal tubular acidosis (type 1)|Distal renal tubular acidosis (type 1)]]
- The Î±-intercalated cells of the distal tubule are unable to secrete H<sup>+</sup>.
## Mixed RTA (type 3)
- Type 1 RTA with HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> wasting
## Hyperkalemic renal tubular acidosis (type 4)
- Aldosterone deficiency and/or resistance in the collecting duct and distal convoluted tubule cause hyperkalemia, which inhibits ammonia synthesis in the proximal convoluted tubule and decreases urinary ammonium excretion.
