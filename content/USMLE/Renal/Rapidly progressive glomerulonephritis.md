# Etiology
Three classifications, same as [[Nephritic syndrome#Etiology|Nephritic syndrome > Etiology]]

# Pathophysiology
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Breaks in the glomerular capillary wall and dysfunction of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) → leakage of plasma proteins (e.g., coagulation factors) and passage of inflammatory cells (macrophages, T cells) into Bowman space</span>![[L13147.jpg|L13147.jpg]]
- Release of inflammatory cytokines → damage to the membrane of Bowman space and passage of cells from the interstitium into Bowman space
- This causes the formation of fibrin clots and proliferation of cells (e.g., macrophages, fibroblasts, neutrophils, epithelial cells) → crescent moon formation → compression of the glomerulus → renal dysfunction

# Clinical features

# Diagnostics
- Antiglomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) RPGN:  Linear GBM deposits of IgG and C3 are found on [[immunofluorescence|immunofluorescence]].  In some patients, anti-GBM antibodies cross-react with pulmonary alveolar basement membranes, producing pulmonary hemorrhages ([[Goodpasture syndrome|Goodpasture syndrome]]).
- Immune-complex RPGN:  There is a "lumpy-bumpy" granular pattern of staining for both antibodies (eg, IgG, IgA) and complement on [[immunofluorescence|immunofluorescence]] microscopy.  This can be a complication of [[poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis|poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis]], [[systemic lupus erythematosus|systemic lupus erythematosus]], [[IgA nephropathy|IgA nephropathy]], or [[IgA vasculitis|Henoch-Schönlein purpura]].
- Pauci-immune RPGN:  There are no immunoglobulin or [[Complement system|complement]] deposits on the basement membrane. Most patients have elevated serum titers of [[Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies|ANCA]].  This condition is often associated with [[vasculitides|vasculitides]] (eg, [[granulomatosis with polyangiitis|granulomatosis with polyangiitis]], microscopic polyangiitis) but can also be idiopathic.
