# Epidemiology
---


# Etiology
---
## Primary narcolepsy
- Narcolepsy type 1 
	- Loss of lateral hypothalamic neurons, which produce hypocretin-1 and hypocretin-2 (i.e. orexin A and orexin B) → severe hypocretin (orexin) deficiency → dysregulation of sleep-wake cycles
- Narcolepsy type 2 
	- Idiopathic
## Secondary narcolepsy
- Cerebral damage (e.g., tumor, stroke, inflammation, vascular malformation)
- Genetic syndromes (e.g., [[Lysosomal Storage Diseases|Niemann-Pick disease]] type C and Prader-Willi syndrome)

# Pathophysiology
---


# Clinical features
---
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Excessive daytime sleepiness</span>: Affected individuals experience an irresistible urge to sleep and sudden, short sleep attacks (< 30 minutes), which may occur in inappropriate situations (e.g., while driving a car).
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Can occur despite adequate sleep </span>
- Abnormal [[Sleep physiology|REM]] sleep
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Cataplexy: sudden muscle weakness in a fully conscious person, triggered by strong emotions (e.g., laughing, crying)</span> 
	- Sleep paralysis: Complete paralysis occurs for 1–2 minutes after waking or before falling asleep (either during a nocturnal or narcoleptic sleep episode, i.e., begins or ends with [[Sleep physiology|REM]] sleep)
- Sleep hallucinations
	- Hypnagogic hallucinations: vivid, often frightening visual or auditory hallucinations that occur as the patient falls asleep
	- Hypnopompic hallucinations: experienced while waking up (less common than hypnagogic hallucinations)

## General measures
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Optimize sleep hygiene. </span>
	- Ensure regular sleep periods during the night.
	- Avoid substances that disturb the sleep-wake cycle (e.g., alcohol, [[antipsychotics|antipsychotics]], opiates).
- Consider scheduled naps throughout the day to reduce the urge to sleep.
## Medical therapy
- First-line medications
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Modafinil: a nonamphetamine CNS stimulant</span>
	- Nighttime sodium oxybate: a sodium salt of gamma hydroxybutyric acid
		- Help control daytime sleepiness by improving nighttime sleep.
