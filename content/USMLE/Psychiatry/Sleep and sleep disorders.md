## Sleep terror disorder
- Definition: a <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">non-REM-related</span> parasomnia that occurs during the N3 sleep stage (slow-wave sleep), characterized by episodes of sleep terror
- Epidemiology: Discrete episodes of sleep terrors are relatively <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">common in children</span> (∼ 20% of children and ∼ 2% of adults), but the disorder is rare.
- Risk factors
	- Stress or fatigue
	- Fever
	- Sleep deprivation
- Clinical features
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Screaming or crying suddenly upon awakening, usually in the first part of the night</span> (rarely during daytime naps) 
	- Intense fear and agitation
	- Tachypnea, diaphoresis, tachycardia during episodes
	- Difficulty arousing patients during episodes
	- Patients usually return to sleep after the episode.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Typically no recollection of the arousal episode (unlike with nightmare disorder)</span>
		- Nightmare disorder
			- a REM-related parasomnia characterized by recurrent nightmares
			- Patient remembers the dream after awakening (<font color="#ffc000">REM</font>ember)
### REM sleep behavior disorder
- Definition: a REM-related parasomnia characterized by dream enactment due to <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">loss of REM sleep atonia</span>
- Epidemiology
	- Sex: ♂ > ♀
	- Usually in older patients (> 50 years)
- Clinical features
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Physically acting out dreams during sleep (e.g., yelling, moving limbs, walking, punching), sometimes leading to injury to self or others</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Patient is alert and orientated after awakening, and remembers the dream.</span>
- Prognosis: Most patients with idiopathic RBD eventually develop a disorder of α-synuclein neurodegeneration, most commonly Parkinson disease.
