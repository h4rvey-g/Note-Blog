- Epidemiology: Discrete episodes of sleep terrors are relatively <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">common in children</span> (∼ 20% of children and ∼ 2% of adults), but the disorder is rare.

		- Nightmare disorder
			- a [[Sleep physiology|REM]]-related parasomnia characterized by recurrent nightmares
			- Patient remembers the dream after awakening (<font color="#ffc000">[[Sleep physiology|REM]]</font>ember)
