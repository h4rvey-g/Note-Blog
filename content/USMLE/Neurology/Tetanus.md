- Tetanospasmin: reaches the CNS through retrograde axonal transport
	- Toxin binds to receptors of peripheral nerves and is then transported to interneurons (Renshaw cells) in the CNS via vesicles. 
	- Acts as protease that cleaves synaptobrevin, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">a SNARE protein</span> → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">prevention of inhibitory neurotransmitters (i.e., [[Neurotransmitters|GABA]] and glycine) release from Renshaw cells in the spinal cord</span> → uninhibited activation of alpha motor neurons → muscle spasms, [[Spasticity (Clonus) vs Rigidity|rigidity]], and autonomic instability
- Tetanolysin: causes hemolysis and has cardiotoxic effects

- Immediately manage life-threatening and severe symptoms.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Administer passive immunization, e.g., human tetanus immunoglobulin (HTIG), as soon as possible.</span>
- Manage acute wounds, e.g., wound irrigation and debridement
- Initiate antibiotics, preferably PO metronidazole.
- Begin active immunization with the tetanus vaccine once the patient is improving.
- Prevention
	- Prevention of neonatal tetanus is achieved primarily by <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">vaccination of the mother during pregnancy</span> with an inactivated tetanus toxin (tetanus toxoid) as part of the tetanus-diptheria (Td) or tetanus-reduced diphteria-acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine.  An appropriately vaccinated woman provides transplacental IgG to the fetus, which decreases the incidence of neonatal tetanus by approximately 95%.
