# Etiology
---
## Acquired cataracts (> 99%)
- Age-related cataract (> 90%)
- As a result of ocular diseases (complicated cataract)
	- Diabetes mellitus
- Drug-induced
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Glucocorticoids (local and systemic)</span>
		- Glucocorticoids increase oxidative stress within the lens by reducing antioxidant defenses like glutathione
- Chronic alcohol and tobacco use 
- Traumatic (traumatic cataract) 
- Eye infections
- Excessive sunlight or UVB exposure

# Pathophysiology
---
- Oxidative damage & opacification of the lens
- Cataracts caused by diabetes: see [[Diabetes mellitus#Other complications|Diabetes mellitus > Other complications]]

# Clinical features
---
- Painless, progressive, bilateral vision loss
- Difficulty with nighttime driving
- Loss of red reflex
- Opacified lens

# Diagnostics
---
- Fundoscopy
	- Changes to the red reflex (the reflection of light in the ocular fundus, which is normally red in color), including: 
		- Opacities (including leukocoria)
		- Darkening
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Absent or decreased red reflex</span>![[L17506.jpg|L17506.jpg]]
- Slit-lamp examination 
	- Common: grey, white, yellow, or brownish clouding of the lens (see also “Types of cataracts”)
