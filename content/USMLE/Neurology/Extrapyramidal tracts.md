- Vestibulospinal tract
	- The lateral vestibulospinal tract controls muscle tone in <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">leg extensors (anti-gravity muscles)</span>, which help <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">maintain upright posture</span>. 
	- The medial vestibulospinal tract innervates neck musculature and facilitates muscle tone and head movements.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Over-extension is prevented by red nucleus</span>
- Ponto reticulospinal tract
	- Originate from pons
	- Assist in posture maintaining, like vestibulospinal tract
- Rubrospinal pathway
	- Assist corticospinal tract to control flexor muscles
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Originate from red nucleus</span>
- Medullary Reticulospinal Tract
	- Similar as above

- Red nucleus is in midbrain, at the level of the [[Oculomotor nerve palsy (III)|oculomotor nerve]] nucleus
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Damage above the red nucleus (eg, cerebral hemisphere, internal capsule) typically results in decorticate (flexor) posturing</span> due to loss of descending inhibition of the red nucleus and subsequent hyperactivity of upper limb flexors.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Damage below the red nucleus (eg, pons) or to the nucleus itself (eg, midbrain) often causes decerebrate (extensor) posturing</span> due to loss of descending excitation to the upper limb flexors (via the rubrospinal tract) and extensor predominance (due to unopposed vestibulospinal tract output).
