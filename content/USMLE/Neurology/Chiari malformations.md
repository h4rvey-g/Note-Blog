# Type I CM (Chiari I malformation)
---
- Usually symptomatic in adolescence/young adulthood:
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Occipital headache (exacerbated by valsalva maneuvers and physical activity)</span>
	- Neck pain
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Radicular pain in the shoulders and arms</span>
	- Lower cranial nerve disorders
	- Cerebellar symptoms (e.g., dysarthria, ataxia)
	- Downbeat [[Internuclear ophthalmoplegia|nystagmus]]
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Some patients develop [[syringomyelia|syringomyelia]] and/or [[hydrocephalus|hydrocephalus]].</span>
# Type II CM (Arnold-Chiari malformation)
---
- Usually symptomatic in infancy
	- Obstructive [[hydrocephalus|hydrocephalus]]: Displacement of brain tissue into the foramen magnum results in stenosis of the cerebral aqueduct
	- Breathing difficulties, including apneic episodes
	- Feeding difficulties 
	- Muscle weakness or numbness
- Always associated with myelomeningocele: manifests with motor and/or sensory deficits at and below the level of the lesion
- Some patients develop [[syringomyelia|syringomyelia]]
