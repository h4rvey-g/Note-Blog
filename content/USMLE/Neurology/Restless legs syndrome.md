The pathophysiology of RLS is incompletely understood but likely involves CNS iron deficiency (even in patients with normal serum iron levels) and abnormalities in dopaminergic transmission.

# Clinical features

- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">A recurrent urge to move the legs that is:</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Typically relieved by movement</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Triggered and/or worsened with rest</span>
	- Worse in the evening and at night (may occur exclusively at night)
- The urge to move the legs is often <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">accompanied by uncomfortable sensations</span> (e.g., pain, pins and needles, itching, tickling, or crawling sensations).

# Treatment

- Provide oral iron supplementation
- Alpha-2-delta ligands (e.g., gabapentin enacarbil, pregabalin, or gabapentin): first-line for most patients, unless contraindicated
- Low-dose nonergot dopamine agonists (e.g., pramipexole, ropinirole, rotigotine)
