## Osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS)
- Definition: damage to the myelin sheath of the white matter in the CNS caused by a sudden rise in serum osmolality 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Central pontine myelinolysis</span> 
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Most common type</span>
		- Affects the central region of the pons
- Causes
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Iatrogenic: rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">High-risk factors for ODS: [[alcohol use disorder|alcohol use disorder]]</span>, malnutrition, liver disease, [[hypokalemia|hypokalemia]], initial sodium concentration â‰¤ 105 mEq/L
	- Rapid changes in other osmotically active solutes (e.g., glucose)
- Clinical features 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Symptoms first develop several days after the correction of hyponatremia.</span>
	- There can be a wide range of symptoms, depending on the degree and location of demyelination.
	- Central pontine myelinolysis
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Altered level of consciousness, including coma</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Locked-in syndrome</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Impaired cranial nerve function: dysarthria, dysphagia, and diplopia </span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Worsening quadriparesis (initially flaccid, later spastic) </span>
			- As a result of corticospinal fiber (UMN) involvement in the basilar pons
