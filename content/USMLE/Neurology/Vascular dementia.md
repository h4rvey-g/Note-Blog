# Epidemiology
---
- Second most common type of dementia (15–20% of cases) 
- Prevalence increases with age (∼ 1–4% in patients ≥ 65 years).

# Etiology
---
- VD may occur as a result of a prolonged and severe cerebral ischemia of any etiology, primarily: 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Large artery occlusion (usually cortical ischemia)</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Lacunar stroke (small vessel occlusion resulting in subcortical ischemia)</span>
	- Chronic subcortical ischemia

# Pathophysiology
---
![[L86625.jpg|L86625.jpg]]
- Large-vessel [[atherosclerosis|atherosclerosis]]
- Small-vessel disease (eg, [[Atherosclerosis|arteriolosclerosis]])
- Cerebral amyloid angiopathy

# Clinical features
---
- Multi-infarct: often with stepwise decline
- Strategic infarct: associated with localizing cortical deficits
	- These infarcts are termed "strategic" because they affect regions that play a crucial role in certain brain functions.
- Subcortical vascular encephalopathy: associated with subcortical signs (eg, [[urinary incontinence|urinary incontinence]], [[gait|gait]] disturbances)

>[!tip] vs [[Alzheimer disease|Alzheimer disease]]
>The most significant symptoms of vascular dementia tend to involve speed of thinking and problem-solving rather than memory loss.
