## Indirect inguinal hernia
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Most commonly results from incomplete obliteration of processus vaginalis during [[Embryogenesis|fetal development]] (but can also be acquired).</span>![[Pasted image 20241013213942.png|Pasted image 20241013213942.png]]![[Pasted image 20241013213954.png|Pasted image 20241013213954.png]]
- May not become apparent until adulthood despite being present since birth.
- Lateral to the inferior epigastric blood vessels (outside Hesselbach triangle)
- Runs from the deep inguinal ring through the inguinal canal to the superficial (external) inguinal ring (in men, along with the spermatic cord)
- Surrounded by the external spermatic fascia, cremasteric [[Skeletal muscle fibers|muscle fibers]], and internal spermatic fascia
- Indirect inguinal hernia may be associated with a communicating [[hydrocele|hydrocele]].

## Postoperative complications
- Inguinodynia; paresthesia or anesthesia over the surgical site
	- Can be secondary to nerve injury during the surgical procedure (i.e., <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">transection of the ilioinguinal nerve or genitofemoral nerve that traverse the inguinal region</span>) or due to nerve entrapment within the mesh.![[Pasted image 20240309172706.png|Pasted image 20240309172706.png]]
