# Pathophysiology
---
![[highresdefault_L80539.jpg|highresdefault_L80539.jpg]]
## Central
- **Anatomical trajectory:** Hypothalamus (first-order oculosympathetic neuron) → brainstem, cervical, and thoracic spinal cord → ciliospinal center (C8–T2)
- **Typical lesions:**
    - Brainstem stroke (e.g., Wallenberg syndrome)
    - Cervical spinal cord injury (e.g., Brown-Séquard syndrome, syringomyelia)
    - Brain tumors
    - Brainstem (pontine) hemorrhage
    - Demyelinating disease (e.g., multiple sclerosis)
    - Malformations (e.g., Arnold-Chiari)
    - Meningitis
## Preganglionic
- **Anatomical trajectory:** Ciliospinal center (second-order oculosympathetic neuron) → pulmonary apex → stellate ganglion → superior cervical ganglion
- **Typical lesions:**
    - Tumors (e.g., breast or lung cancer compressing stellate ganglion, esp. Pancoast tumor)![[highresdefault_L15834.jpg|highresdefault_L15834.jpg]]
    - Iatrogenic (e.g., birth trauma, central venous catheterization)
    - Lymphadenopathy
    - Arterial lesions/dissection: aorta, subclavian, common carotid
    - Cervical rib
## Postganglionic
- **Anatomical trajectory:** Superior cervical ganglion (third-order oculosympathetic neuron) → internal carotid artery and ophthalmic nerve → iris dilator muscle
- **Typical lesions:**
    - Dissection of the internal carotid artery
    - Cluster headache
    - Cavernous sinus
    - Tumor
    - Herpes zoster infection
# Clinical features
---
- Triad of Horner syndrome 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Miosis (constriction of the pupil)</span>
		- Occurs because the sympathetically controlled iris dilator muscle fails to contract. See [[Pupillary light reflex|Pupillary light reflex]].
		- Leads to anisocoria and a dilation lag on exam
			- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">More noticeable in the dark when the sympathetic tone is increased</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Partial ptosis (drooping of the upper eyelid)</span>
		- Occurs because the sympathetically controlled superior tarsal muscle fails to keep the upper eyelid raised
		- It is milder than ptosis associated with [[Oculomotor nerve palsy (III)|oculomotor nerve]] or levator palpebrae muscle lesions.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Anhidrosis (absence of sweating) or reduced sweating on the face and arm, depending on the location of the lesion</span>
		- Occurs because the sympathetic innervation of the facial [[sweat glands|sweat glands]] is impaired
		- Seen in central and preganglionic lesions 
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Facial flushing due to vasodilatation</span> 
	- Occurs because the vasoconstrictive effect of the sympathetic nervous system is lost.
- (Apparent) enophthalmos 
- Associated symptoms depending on the etiology:
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Atrophy of arm and hand muscles </span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Infiltration of the [[brachial plexus|brachial plexus]]</span> causes pain (plexus neuralgia), as well as motor and sensory deficits in the arm.
	- Pain in the neck or face
