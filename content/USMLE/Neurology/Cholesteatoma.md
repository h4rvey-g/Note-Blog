>Cholesteatomas are collections of <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">squamous cell debris</span> that form a round, pearly mass. Despite what the name implies, cholesteatomas do not contain any lipid or cholesterol components.

<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Keratinizing squamous epithelium grows from the tympanic membrane or the auditory canal into the middle ear mucosa or mastoid air cells.</span>![[Pasted image 20231231112217.png|Pasted image 20231231112217.png]]
- Congenital cholesteatoma
- Acquired cholesteatoma (more common)
	- Primary: eustachian tube dysfunction → tympanic membrane epithelium retracts inwards → retraction pocket
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Secondary: Epithelium migrates inwards through a perforation in the tympanic membrane, which is commonly caused by recurrent/chronic otitis media.</span>

# Clinical features
- Painless otorrhea (scant but foul-smelling discharge from the affected ear)
- Conductive [[hearing loss|hearing loss]]

---
# Diagnostics
- Otoscopic findings:
	- Primary acquired: retraction pocket with squamous epithelium and debris that often appears as a brown, irregular mass
	- Congenital and secondary acquired: white or pearly mass behind the tympanic membrane
