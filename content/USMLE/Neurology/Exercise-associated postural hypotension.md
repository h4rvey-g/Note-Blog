- Definition: inability to stand or walk without assistance (i.e., collapse) <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">after vigorous exertion</span>
- Epidemiology: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">occurs most commonly in athletes (especially upon completion of endurance running)</span>
- Pathophysiology
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">During exercise, ↑ blood flow to muscles of the lower extremities → ↑ skeletal muscle pump activity → ↑ venous return to the heart</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Sudden cessation of exercise → loss of skeletal muscle pump activity → ↓ venous return → large volumes of blood pool in the lower extremities → postural hypotension → collapse</span>
- Clinical features
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Dizziness, weakness (usually, no loss of consciousness)</span>
