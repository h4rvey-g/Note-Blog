# Clinical features

- All types 
	- Intellectual disability (50%) 
	- Seizure disorder (35%–50%)
	- Upper motor neuron signs (e.g., [[Spasticity (Clonus) vs Rigidity|spasticity]], hyperreflexia, [[Spasticity (Clonus) vs Rigidity|clonus]])
	- Behavioral difficulties
	- Developmental delay, particularly motor function (e.g., rolling over from back to belly, sitting independently, crawling).
	- Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Spastic type</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↑ Muscle tone in one or more limbs </span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↑ Deep tendon reflexes</span>
		- Persistence of primitive reflexes (e.g., positive Babinski sign)
