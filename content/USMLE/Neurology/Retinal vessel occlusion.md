# Epidemiology


---
# Etiology
## Retinal artery occlusion
- Embolism
	- Release of thrombotic emboli as a result of carotid artery [[atherosclerosis|atherosclerosis]] (most common)
## Retinal vein occlusion
- Systemic diseases
	- [[Atherosclerosis|Atherosclerosis]]
	- Hypertension
	- [[Diabetes mellitus|Diabetes mellitus]]

# Clinical features
## Retinal artery occlusion
- CRAO
	- Sudden, painless loss of vision in one eye (often described as a “descending curtain”)
	- Ophthalmoscopic findings
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Grayish-white (cloudy) discoloration of the entire retina </span>
			- A result of edema within the nerve fiber layer (NFL)
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Cherry-red spot at the fovea centralis</span>![[Pasted image 20240108102210.png|Pasted image 20240108102210.png]]
			- No nerve fibers are present in the foveal avascular zone (FAZ). Therefore, the FAZ is not affected by edema of the nerve fiber layer. The underlying choroid is clearly visible as a cherry-red spot against a dull white background.
- BRAO
	- Sudden onset of visual field defects (scotomas) in the affected eye
	- Ophthalmoscopic findings
		- Grayish-white discoloration of the retinal quadrant supplied by the affected vessel
# Retinal vein occlusion
- Ischemic CRVO
	- Sudden, severe loss of vision in the affected eye
	- Ophthalmoscopic findings
		- Many dot-and-blot and/or flame-shaped hemorrhages in all four retinal quadrants and venous thickening (<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">blood and thunder appearance</span>)![[Pasted image 20240108102233.png|Pasted image 20240108102233.png]]
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Cotton wool spots</span>
			- Characterized by yellow-white deposits on the retina
			- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Caused by swelling of retinal nerve fibers due to ischemia</span>
		- Severe macular edema
		- Severe papilledema

# Diagnostics
## Retinal artery occlusion
- Evaluation for cardiovascular risk factors: 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Carotid doppler (to look for atherosclerotic plaques)</span>
	- Echocardiography (to identify potential sources of emboli, e.g. cardiac vegetations, patent foramen ovale)
- Tests to rule out temporal arteritis:
	- Inflammatory markers (e.g., ↑ ESR)
	- Temporal artery biopsy

>[!tip] 
>Retinal artery occlusion is also called 'retinal stroke”; patients with retinal artery occlusion are at a significantly higher risk of having a stroke.
