The retinoblastoma gene (Rb) is a tumor suppressor gene found on chromosome 13.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Heritable retinoblastomas</span> (autosomal dominant inheritance)
	- Two-hit hypothesis
	- Inherited retinoblastomas tend to be <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">bilateral</span>.
		- Since all retinal cells have already lost one allele and the probability of losing the second allele in both eyes is quite high
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Have a significantly higher risk of developing osteosarcomas</span> and pinealomas.
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">They are also caused by mutations of Rb gene.</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Sporadic retinoblastomas</span>: due to spontaneous mutation â†’
	- Two spontaneous mutations must occur in the same retinal cell, affecting both Rb alleles.
	- Sporadic retinoblastomas tend to be <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">unilateral</span>
