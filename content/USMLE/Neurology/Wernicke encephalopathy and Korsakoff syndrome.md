# Epidemiology


---
# Etiology
- Wernicke encephalopathy and Korsakoff syndrome are caused by a severe deficiency of [[Vitamin B1|thiamine]] ([[vitamin B1|vitamin B1]]).
- [[Vitamin B1|Thiamine]] deficiency can be due to:
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Chronic heavy alcohol use (most common)</span>: due to inadequate intake, absorption, and hepatic storage of thiamine
	- Inadequate intake
		- Thiamine-deficient diets 
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[Anorexia nervosa|Anorexia nervosa]]</span>, [[Metabolic fuel use|starvation]]
			- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">In patients with low glucose intake, thiamine deficiency may be asymptomatic. However, this patient ingested a large quantity of glucose, which likely rapidly depleted her limited thiamine stores.</span>
	- [[Malabsorption|Malabsorption]]

# Pathophysiology
- [[Vitamin B1|Thiamine]] deficiency → decreased cerebral glucose metabolism and mitochondrial dysfunction → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">depleted ATP and increased free radicals → injury of neuronal elements</span> (e.g., myelin sheaths, blood-brain-barrier, decreased [[neurotransmitters|neurotransmitters]], etc.) → impaired axonal conduction → symptoms of Wernicke encephalopathy and Korsakoff syndrome
- In patients with Korsakoff syndrome: long term [[Vitamin B1|thiamine]] deficiency → permanent damage to components of the limbic system (e.g., <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">mammillary bodies, anterior thalamic nuclei</span>) → atrophy of these components → memory loss, apathy, and disrupted emotional processing

# Clinical features
## Wernicke encephalopathy (acute, reversible)
- Should be suspected in any patient with a history of chronic heavy alcohol use who presents with one/more symptoms of the<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)"> classic triad of Wernicke encephalopathy</span> 
	1. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Confusion (most common) </span>
		- Disorientation, impaired vigilance, and cognitive deficits
	2. Oculomotor dysfunction 
		- Due to involvement of the [[Oculomotor nerve palsy (III)|CN III]], CN IV, and CN VI nuclei
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Gaze-induced horizontal/vertical [[Internuclear ophthalmoplegia|nystagmus]] (most common)</span>
		- Diplopia 
		- Conjugate gaze palsy
	3. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[Gait|Gait]] ataxia: wide-based, small steps </span>
		- Due to a combination of peripheral neuropathy, vestibular dysfunction, and cerebellar dysfunction
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[Romberg test|Romberg test]] positive</span>

>[!tip] When to suspect
>Wernicke encephalopathy should be suspected in any patient with <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">chronic alcohol abuse or any form of malnutrition and any of the following: acute altered mental status, ophthalmoplegia, ataxic [[gait|gait]], [[delirium|delirium]], and hypotension.</span>
