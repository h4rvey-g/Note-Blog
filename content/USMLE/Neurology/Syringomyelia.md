# Epidemiology


---
# Etiology
- [[Chiari malformations|Arnold-chiari malformation]], especially type I (most common cause)
- Posttraumatic [[Neuroloy physioloy|Neuroloy physioloy]] injury (3–4% of patients with SCI develop symptomatic syringomyelia)
	- Symptoms of syringomyelia may only develop months to years after the injury. The injury typically affects the cervical spine (e.g., following a motor vehicle accident).

# Pathophysiology
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Obstructed central canal of spinal cord (usually in the cervical spine</span>, the thoracic or lumbar spine are less commonly affected)  → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">impaired [[Cerebrospinal fluid analysis|CSF]] drainage → formation of a dilated fluid-filled cavity in central spinal cord (syrinx) → compression of the anterior white commissure and damage (with reactive gliosis) to crossing neural fibers (from the second-order neurons) of the lateral spinothalamic tract first (which affect pain and temperature) → bilateral dissociated sensory loss and dysesthetic pain</span>![[Pasted image 20240109084639.png|Pasted image 20240109084639.png]]
- Expansion of the syrinx may damage:
	- Lower motor neurons in the anterior horns at segment level → initially bilateral weakness → eventual bilateral flaccid paresis and muscle atrophy 
		- Muscle atrophy typically begins in the hands and progresses to the arms and shoulders.
	- Upper motor neurons in the medial part of the lateral corticospinal tract → unilateral or bilateral spastic paresis below the level of the syrinx
	- Descending hypothalamic fibers in T1 to T4 cord segments → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[Horner syndrome|Horner syndrome]]</span>

>[!tip] 
>Syringomyelia is an abnormal fluid-filled dilation of the central canal of the spinal cord occurring as a result of impaired [[Cerebrospinal fluid analysis|CSF]] flow.

# Clinical features
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Often asymptomatic</span>  and/or slowly progressing (similar to central cord syndrome) 
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Cape-like distribution (neck, shoulders, arms)</span>
	- The sensation deficit may be exacerbated with raised intramedullary pressure due to coughing, sneezing, or raised intra-abdominal pressure (e.g., straining because of constipation).
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Dissociated sensory loss </span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">The loss of sensation of pain and temperature, while the sensation of light touch, vibration, and position remain intact.</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Dysthetic pain</span> 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Muscle atrophy, fasciculations, and areflexia (patients may present with a claw hand deformity)</span>
- Syringobulbia: a neurological disorder characterized by syringomyelia affecting the brainstem
	- Tongue atrophy 
	- Loss of pain and temperature sensation in trigeminal nerve
	- [[Internuclear ophthalmoplegia|Nystagmus]]
	- Dysphagia
	- Palatal and pharyngeal weakness
