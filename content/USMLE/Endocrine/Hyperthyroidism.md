# Definition
- Thyrotoxicosis: a hypermetabolic condition caused by an inappropriately high level of circulating thyroid hormones irrespective of the source. 
- Hyperthyroidism: a condition characterized by <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">the overproduction of thyroid hormones by the thyroid gland</span>; can cause thyrotoxicosis
	- Overt hyperthyroidism
		- ↓ Serum TSH levels with ↑ serum free T4 and/or T3 levels
		- Patients typically experience symptoms of thyrotoxicosis.
		- E.g., [[Graves disease|Graves disease]], [[Toxic multinodular goiter|toxic MNG]], and toxic adenoma
	- Subclinical hyperthyroidism
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↓ Serum TSH levels with normal serum free T4 and T3 levels</span>
		- Patients are normally <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic.</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">May progress to overt hyperthyroidism</span>
		- If the negative feedback regulation mechanism is intact, increased T3 and T4 lead to TSH suppression, which in turn leads to reduced stimulation of thyroid follicular cells. Thyroid hormone levels may then be normal.

# Clinical features
- Musculoskeletal
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Fine [[tremor|tremor]] of the outstretched fingers</span>
	- Hyperthyroid myopathy: a condition of muscle weakness, pain, and atrophy associated with hyperthyroidism (e.g., from [[Graves disease|Graves disease]], thyroiditis)
		- Predominantly affects individuals > 40 years of age
		- Can develop acutely or several weeks to months after the onset of hyperthyroidism.
		- Typically affects proximal muscles (e.g., hip flexors, quadriceps) more than distal muscles
		- Serum creatine kinase levels are most often normal
- Osteopathy: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[osteoporosis|osteoporosis]]</span> due to the direct effect of T3 on osteoclastic bone resorption, fractures (in the elderly)
	- In <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">long-standing hyperthyroidism</span>
- Endocrinological
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Female: oligo/amenorrhoea, anovulatory infertility, dysfunctional uterine bleeding </span>
		- Serum sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels are high in hyperthyroidism → low serum free (unbound) estradiol concentrations
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Male: [[gynecomastia|gynecomastia]], decreased libido, infertility, erectile dysfunction </span>

# Treatment
![[Pasted image 20240413093315.png|Pasted image 20240413093315.png]]
## Thionamides
- Examples	
	- Methimazole (MMI)
	- Carbimazole
	- Propylthiouracil (PTU)
- Mechanism of action
	- Inhibits thyroid hormone production via <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">inhibition of thyroid peroxidase → blockade of iodide oxidation, organification, coupling</span>
	- Propylthiouracil also lowers peripheral conversion of T4 to T3 by inhibiting 5'-deiodinase.
- Adverse effects
	- Allergy/hypersensitivity
		- The most common side effect is a pruritic rash (particularly with methimazole)
	- Hematologic side effects
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Agranulocytosis</span>
			- Rare but dangerous (affects ∼ 0.5% of patients; more common in elderly and those taking high doses)
			- Rapidly reversible with discontinuation of treatment
		- Aplastic anemia
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hepatotoxicity (seen with propylthiouracil use)</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Teratogenicity: increased risk of congenital malformations with carbimazole and methimazole (e.g., aplasia cutis)</span>

>[!tip] 
>As methimazole and carbimazole are teratogenic, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">propylthiouracil is recommended in the first trimester. After the first trimester, switch back to carbimazole or methimazole</span> because of the hepatotoxic effects of propylthiouracil.
## Potassium iodides
<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">In the event of a nuclear accident, potassium iodide is given prophylactically to protect the thyroid from excessive accumulation of radioactive <sup>131</sup>I.</span>
