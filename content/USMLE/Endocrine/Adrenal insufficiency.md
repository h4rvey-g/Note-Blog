# Etiology
## Primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison disease)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Autoimmune adrenalitis</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Most common cause in the US</span> (∼ 80–90% of all cases of primary adrenal insufficiency)
	- Caused by autoimmune destruction of both adrenal cortices
	- Associated with other autoimmune endocrinopathies
- Infectious adrenalitis
	- [[Tuberculosis|Tuberculosis]]: most common cause worldwide, but rare in the US
	- [[Cytomegalovirus infection|CMV]] disease in immunosuppressed states (especially AIDS)
	- [[Histoplasmosis|Histoplasmosis]]
- Adrenal hemorrhage 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Sepsis: especially meningococcal sepsis (endotoxic shock) → hemorrhagic necrosis ([[Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome|Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome]])</span>
	- Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)
- Infiltration of the adrenal glands
	- Tumors (adrenocortical tumors, lymphomas, metastatic carcinoma)
	- [[Amyloidosis|Amyloidosis]]
	- [[Hemochromatosis|Hemochromatosis]]
- Adrenalectomy
- Impaired activity of enzymes that are responsible for cortisol synthesis
	- Cortisol synthesis inhibitors (e.g., rifampin, fluconazole, phenytoin, ketoconazole): drug-induced adrenal insufficiency
	- 21β-hydroxylase deficiency
## Tertiary adrenal insufficiency
Tertiary adrenal insufficiency is caused by conditions that <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">decrease CRH production.</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">The most common cause is sudden discontinuation of chronic glucocorticoid therapy.</span>
- Rarer causes include hypothalamic dysfunction (e.g., due to trauma, mass, hemorrhage, or anorexia): ↓ CRH → ↓ ACTH → ↓ cortisol release

# Clinical features
## Hypocortisolism
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Weight loss</span>, anorexia
- Fatigue, lethargy, depression
- Muscle aches
- Weakness
- Gastrointestinal complaints (e.g., nausea, vomiting, [[diarrhea|diarrhea]])
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[Permissive action|Permissive action]]</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Sugar cravings</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">(Orthostatic) hypotension</span>
		- Glucocorticoids play an important role in catecholamine‑induced vasoconstriction and myocardial contractility.

### Lab findings
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[Hypoglycemia|Hypoglycemia]] </span>
	- Glucocorticoids inhibit peripheral glucose utilization and increase [[gluconeogenesis|gluconeogenesis]].
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hyponatremia</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Glucocorticoids inhibit ADH secretion and thereby prevent excessive water retention. With adrenal insufficiency, ADH secretion is disinhibited causing increased reabsorption of free water with subsequent dilution hyponatremia.</span>
## Hypoaldosteronism 
- Hypotension
- Salt craving
### Lab findings
- Hyponatremia
- [[Hyperkalemia|Hyperkalemia]]
- Normal anion gap metabolic acidosis
## <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hypoandrogenism</span>
- Loss of libido
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Loss of axillary and pubic hair</span>
### Lab findings
- ↓ DHEA-S
## Elevated ACTH
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hyperpigmentation of areas that are not normally exposed to sunlight (e.g., palmar creases, mucous membrane of the oral cavity)</span> → tanned skin![[Pasted image 20231222100938.png|Pasted image 20231222100938.png]]
	- caused by increased production of MSH, which is cleaved from the same precursor peptide (POMC) as ACTH.

# Diagnostics
- Overnight <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">metyrapone stimulation test</span>
	- Physiological response: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">metyrapone inhibits 11β hydroxylase → impaired conversion of 11-deoxycortisol to cortisol (last step of cortisol synthesis) → ↓ serum cortisol → ↑ in CRH and plasma ACTH (negative feedback) → ↑ in adrenal steroidogenesis → ↑ in 11-deoxycortisol level</span>![[L20059.jpg|L20059.jpg]]
	- In primary adrenal insufficiency: metyrapone → ↓ cortisol synthesis → ↑ in CRH/ACTH → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">no increase in adrenal steroid production → no increase in 11-deoxycortisol or cortisol levels</span>
	- In secondary/tertiary adrenal insufficiency: metyrapone → ↓ cortisol → no increase in CRH/ACTH → no increase in adrenal steroid production → no increase in 11-deoxycortisol or cortisol levels

# Treatment

# Adrenal crisis
Adrenal crisis is an <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">acute, severe glucocorticoid deficiency that requires immediate emergency treatment.</span>
## Precipitating factors for adrenal crisis
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Stress in patients with underlying adrenal insufficiency</span> e.g.:
	- Gastrointestinal illness (most common)
	- Other infections
	- Perioperative period
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Sudden discontinuation of glucocorticoids</span> after prolonged glucocorticoid therapy 
- Bilateral adrenal hemorrhage or infarction (e.g., [[Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome|Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome]])
- Pituitary apoplexy
>[!tip] 
>In order to prevent the development of secondary and tertiary adrenal insufficiency, prolonged steroid therapy should be tapered slowly rather than stopped abruptly.

## Signs and symptoms
- Hypotension, shock
- Impaired consciousness, coma
- Fever
- Vomiting, diarrhea
- Severe abdominal pain (which can resemble peritonitis)
# Autoimmune polyglandular syndromes
