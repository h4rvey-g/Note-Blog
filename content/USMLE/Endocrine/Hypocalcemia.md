## Neurological manifestations
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Tetany: increased neuromuscular excitability</span> (when caused by respiratory alkalosis = hyperventilation-induced tetany)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Paresthesias: typically tingling or pins-and-needles sensation in extremities and/or in the perioral area</span>
	- Spasms (e.g., <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">carpopedal spasm</span>, bronchospasm or laryngospasm), and cramps (possible in any muscle)
	- Stiffness, myalgia
	- Maneuvers to elicit latent tetany on physical exam
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Chvostek sign: short contractions (twitching) of the facial muscles elicited by tapping the facial nerve below and in front of the ear</span> (âˆ¼ 2 cm ventral to the ear lobe) 
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Trousseau sign: ipsilateral carpopedal spasm occurring several minutes after inflation of a blood pressure cuff to pressures above the systolic blood pressure </span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Seizure</span>: may be the initial or only symptom
