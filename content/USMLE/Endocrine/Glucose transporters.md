- GLUT-1 contributes to basal glucose transport in erythrocytes and at the blood-brain barrier.
- GLUT-2 is present in hepatocytes, pancreatic beta cells, and at the basolateral membrane of renal tubules and small intestinal mucosa.  It plays a role in absorption of dietary glucose, reabsorption of glucose from renal tubules, hepatic glucose regulation, and sensitivity of beta cells to circulating glucose.
- GLUT-3 is involved in placental and neuronal glucose transport.
