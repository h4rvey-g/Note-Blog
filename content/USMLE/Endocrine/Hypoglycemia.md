# Pathophysiology
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Neurogenic symptoms are mediated via norepinephrine/epinephrine and acetylcholine</span> release during sytimpathec stimulation. Symptoms due to norepinephrine/epinephrine include tremulousness, tachycardia, and anxiety/arousal, whereas acetylcholine causes sweating, hunger, and paresthesias.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Neuroglycopenic symptoms are due to inadequate availability of glucose in the CNS and include behavioral changes, confusion, visual disturbances, stupor, and seizures.</span>

# Clinical features
- Beta blockers can mask signs of hypoglycemia.
	- Nonselective beta blockers attenuate the norepinephrine/epinephrine-mediated symptoms of hypoglycemia, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">but cholinergic symptoms (eg, hunger) are unaffected.</span>
	- In addition, nonselective beta blockers can contribute to the severity of hypoglycemia; epinephrine stimulates hepatic gluconeogenesis and peripheral glycogenolysis, but this effect is diminished by nonselective beta blockers.

# Treatment
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Alert and oriented patients</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Oral glucose 15â€“20 g </span>
	- Fast-acting carbohydrates (e.g., glucose tablets, candy, or fruit juice)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Patients with altered mental status (or impaired oral intake) </span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">IV dextrose</span> (e.g., D50W): Repeat after 15 minutes if hypoglycemia persists; multiple doses may be required. 
		- Adults: 50% dextrose
		- Children (excluding neonates): 10% dextrose OR 25% dextrose
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">IM glucagon: if neither oral nor IV routes of administering glucose are feasible</span>
		- Glucagon therapy is only successful if the patient's glycogen reserves have not been depleted, as glucagon elevates endogenous glucose production via hepatic glycogenolysis and [[gluconeogenesis|gluconeogenesis]].

>[!tip] 
>For patients with [[Diabetes mellitus|type 1 diabetes]] presenting with hypoglycemia and using insulin pumps, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">do not discontinue insulin pumps</span> and treat hypoglycemia as usual. Removing the insulin pump puts patients at risk for [[Hyperglycemic crises|diabetic ketoacidosis]].

>[!warning] 
>Avoid giving orange juice to patients with [[Chronic kidney disease|CKD]] on a low-potassium diet as it is high in potassium.
