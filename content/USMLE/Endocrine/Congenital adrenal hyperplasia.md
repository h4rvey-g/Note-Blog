# Pathophysiology
- CAH is caused by autosomal recessive defects in enzymes that are responsible for the production of cortisol.
- There are three subtypes of CAH:
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">21β-hydroxylase (∼ 95% of CAH)</span>
	- 11β-hydroxylase (∼ 5% of CAH)
	- 17α-hydroxylase (rare)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Low levels of cortisol → lack of negative feedback to the pituitary → increased ACTH → adrenal hyperplasia and increased synthesis of adrenal precursor steroids</span>

><span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">DOC (11-Deoxycorticosterone) has aldosterone-like activity</span>, and in high levels, it causes hypertension and kaluresis and inhibits the production of renin and consequently aldosterone.

>[!Mnemonic] 
>- “1 DOC:” If the deficient enzyme starts with 1 (11β-, 17‑), there is increased DOC.
>- “AND 1:” If the deficient enzyme ends with 1 (21-, 11β‑), androgens are increased.
