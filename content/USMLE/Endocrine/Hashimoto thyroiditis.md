# Epidemiology
- Hashimoto disease is <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">the most common form of thyroiditis and the most frequent cause of [[hypothyroidism|hypothyroidism]] in the US.</span>
- Iodine deficiency is the most common cause of [[hypothyroidism|hypothyroidism]] worldwide.
- Sex: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">♀ > ♂ (7:1)</span>
- Age of onset: occurs in all age groups; <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">most prevalent in women aged 30–50 years</span>

# Etiology


---
# Pathophysiology
- Associations with [[HLA system|HLA-DR3]], and DR5 have been proposed.
- Cellular (especially T cells) and humoral immune responses are activated  → active <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">B lymphocytes produce thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAbs) and thyroglobulin antibodies (TgAbs) → destruction of thyroid tissue</span>

# Clinical features
- Early-stage
	- Primarily asymptomatic
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[Goiter|Goiter]]: nontender or painless</span>, rubbery thyroid with moderate and symmetrical enlargement
	- Hashitoxicosis may occur: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">transient thyrotoxicosis</span> due to follicular rupture of hormone-containing thyroid tissue that manifests with signs of [[hyperthyroidism|hyperthyroidism]] (e.g., irritability, heat intolerance, [[diarrhea|diarrhea]])
- Late-stage
	- Thyroid may be normal-sized or small if extensive fibrosis has occurred.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Signs of [[hypothyroidism|hypothyroidism]]</span> (e.g., cold intolerance, constipation, fatigue)

# Diagnostics
- Thyroid function tests (TFTs)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Early-stage: Transient hashitoxicosis</span> may appear (↓ TSH, ↑ FT3, and ↑ FT4).
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Progression: subclinical [[hypothyroidism|hypothyroidism]]</span> (mildly ↑ TSH; normal FT3 and FT4) 
	- Late-stage: overt [[hypothyroidism|hypothyroidism]] (↑ TSH; ↓ FT4 and ↓ FT3)
- Thyroid antibodies
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Anti-TPOAbs</span> (formerly anti-microsomal antibodies): positive in up to 95% of patients
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Anti-TgAbs</span>: positive in 60–80% of patients
- Fine-needle aspiration
	- Indications: patients with focal nodules to exclude malignancy (see “Workup of thyroid nodules”)
	- Findings: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">diffuse lymphocytic infiltration (cytotoxic T lymphocytes) with germinal centers, oncocytic-metaplastic cells (Hurthle cells)</span>, and fibrotic tissue![[L63985.png|L63985.png]]
 - Differential from [[Subacute thyroiditis|Subacute thyroiditis]]![[L66263.png|L66263.png]]![[Pasted image 20231217175517.png|Pasted image 20231217175517.png]]
