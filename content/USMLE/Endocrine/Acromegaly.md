# Epidemiology

# Etiology

- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Benign growth hormone-secreting [[pituitary adenoma|pituitary adenoma]] (> 95% of cases)</span>

# Pathophysiology

![[L19257.jpg|L19257.jpg]]
- Physiology of GH and IGF-1 
	- GH secretion induced by stress, sport, and [[hypoglycemia|hypoglycemia]]; inhibited especially by hyperglycemia or food intake
	- [[Hypothalamus|Hypothalamus]] secretes GHRH → ↑ secretion of GH  → GH induces IGF-1 synthesis → ↑ serum IGF-1 via liver synthesis which leads to the following effects: 
		- Binding to IGF-1 and insulin receptors → stimulation of cell growth and proliferation, inhibiting programmed cell death
			- Proliferative effects especially on bone, cartilage, skeletal muscle, skin, soft tissue, and organs
			- Impaired glucose tolerance caused by binding to insulin receptors
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↑ Secretion of somatostatin from the [[hypothalamus|hypothalamus]] → ↓ serum GH and IGF-1 (negative feedback)</span>
- Effects of a [[pituitary adenoma|pituitary adenoma]]
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Overproduction of GH → abnormally high serum IGF-1 levels → overstimulation of cell growth and proliferation → symptoms of acromegaly</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Impaired secretion of other pituitary hormones, especially gonadotropins → ↓ [[LH and FSH|LH and FSH]] → ↓ [[Androgen and estrogen synthesis|estrogen]] and testosterone</span>

# Clinical features
---
- Tumor mass effects 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Headache, vision loss (bitemporal hemianopsia)</span>, cranial nerve palsies
	- ♂: Erectile dysfunction, decreased libido
- Soft tissue effects
	- Doughy skin texture, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">hyperhidrosis</span>
		- Caused by enlarged [[sweat glands|sweat glands]]
	- Deepening of the voice, macroglossia with fissures, [[obstructive sleep apnea|obstructive sleep apnea]] 
		- Caused by enlargement of larynx and pharynx in addition to macroglossia
- Skeletal effects
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Coarsening of facial features slowly progressing with age: enlarged nose, forehead, and jaw (macrognathia) with diastema</span>  
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Widened hands, fingers, and feet </span>
