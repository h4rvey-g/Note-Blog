- Epidemiology
	- Most common in individuals 50–70 years of age
- Etiology
	- Genetic susceptibility
		- Presence of a genetic mutation that causes <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">decreased acetyltransferase activity, which results in the slow acetylation of drugs</span>
	- Drug triggers 
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">High risk: procainamide and hydralazine </span>
		- Low risk: sulfa drugs and certain nonsulfa drugs, (e.g., <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">isoniazid</span>, methyldopa, minocycline, phenytoin, TNF-α inhibitors)
- Clinical features (usually manifest ≥ 1 month after medication initiation)
	- Constitutional: fatigue, fever, and weight loss
	- Musculoskeletal: myalgia and symmetrical polyarthralgia
	- Skin lesions (e.g., malar rash)
- Diagnostics
	- ANAs are positive in nearly all patients.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Antihistone antibodies</span>
		- Antihistone antibodies are seen in 90–95% of patients.![[Pasted image 20240116151535.png|Pasted image 20240116151535.png]]

>DILE can manifest with various features that are also seen in idiopathic [[Systemic lupus erythematosus|SLE]] (e.g., fever, arthritis, malar rash, serositis) <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">but typically does not affect the CNS or kidneys, unlike [[Systemic lupus erythematosus|SLE]].</span>
