## S3
- Features
	- Heard just after S2 <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">(after opening of mitral valve)</span>
	- Caused by reverberant sound as <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">blood fills an enlarged LV cavity</span> during passive diastolic filling (i.e. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">end systolic volume is high</span>)
- Associated disorders
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[Heart failure|Heart failure]] with reduced EF</span>
	- High-output states (eg, thyrotoxicosis)
	- Mitral or aortic regurgitation
	- Teens or athletes
		- Hearts are trained to handle more blood
## S4
- Features
	- Heard just before S1 <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">(before closing of mitral valve)</span>
	- Caused by blood striking a <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">stiff LV wall</span> during atrial contraction
		- As the atria contracts in late diastole against a stiffened ventricle, it must increase its force-production, which creates turbulent blood flow.
- Associated disorders
	- Concentric LV hypertrophy
	- [[Restrictive cardiomyopathy|Restrictive cardiomyopathy]]
	- Acute myocardial infarction
