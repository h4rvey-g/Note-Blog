- Definition: an injury of the thoracic aorta resulting from blunt trauma; <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">most commonly occurs distal to the left subclavian artery in the aortic isthmus (between Aortic arch and descending aorta)</span>![[highresdefault_L101439.jpg|highresdefault_L101439.jpg]]
- Etiology: rapid deceleration from blunt trauma (e.g., MVC, fall from height)
- Clinical features: Severity ranges from intimal lesions (e.g., aortic pseudocoarctation) to thoracic aortic rupture.
	- Chest pain
	- Upper [[back pain|back pain]]
	- [[Dyspnea|Dyspnea]], hoarseness and/or stridor
	- Dysphagia
	- Chest wall instability and/or ecchymoses
	- New interscapular murmur
	- Thoracic aortic rupture: signs of hemorrhagic shock (e.g., tachycardia, hypotension) and tearing pain
- Imaging 
	- CXR (initial imaging); potential findings include:
		- Left main bronchus depression
		- Tracheal deviation
		- Apical pleural cap
		- Left [[pleural effusion|pleural effusion]] (hemothorax)
		- Obscuration of the aortic knob
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Mediastinal widening</span>
	- Definitive imaging
		- CTA chest in hemodynamically stable patients
		- Transesophageal echocardiography
