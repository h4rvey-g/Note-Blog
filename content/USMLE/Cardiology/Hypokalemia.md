# Epidemiology

# Etiology
---
- Decreased intake
	- [[Metabolic fuel use|Starvation]], anorexia
- Intracellular translocation
	- Insulin (eg, treatment of [[Hyperglycemic crises|DKA]], refeeding syndrome)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">β-adrenergic activity</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Pharmacologic (eg, albuterol, dobutamine)</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Stress-induced (eg, [[alcohol withdrawal|alcohol withdrawal]], acute MI)</span>
			- Catecholamine (eg, norepinephrine, epinephrine) release. Epinephrine activates the beta-2 receptor, leading to increased activity of the sodium-potassium ATPase pump and the sodium-potassium-2-chloride cotransporter, both of which transport potassium intracellularly.
	- Alkalosis (respiratory or metabolic)
	- ↑ Cell reproduction (eg, [[Acute leukemia|acute myeloid leukemia]], GM-CSF)
- Gastrointestinal loss
	- Diarrhea, vomiting, [[Primary hyperaldosteronism|hyperaldosteronism]]
- Urinary loss
	- [[Primary hyperaldosteronism|Hyperaldosteronism]], diuretics, [[Renal tubular disorders|RTA]] types 1 and 2
- Sweat loss
	- Extreme exercise in hot climate

# Pathophysiology
---
- ↑ Extracellular K+concentration → resting membrane potential becomes less negative than -90 mV → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↑ excitability</span>
