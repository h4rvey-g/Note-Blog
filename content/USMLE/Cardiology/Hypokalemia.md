- Decreased intake
	- Starvation, anorexia
- Intracellular translocation
	- Insulin (eg, treatment of DKA, refeeding syndrome)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">β-adrenergic activity</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Pharmacologic (eg, albuterol, dobutamine)</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Stress-induced (eg, alcohol withdrawal, acute MI)</span>
			- Catecholamine (eg, norepinephrine, epinephrine) release. Epinephrine activates the beta-2 receptor, leading to increased activity of the sodium-potassium ATPase pump and the sodium-potassium-2-chloride cotransporter, both of which transport potassium intracellularly.
	- Alkalosis (respiratory or metabolic)
	- ↑ Cell reproduction (eg, acute myeloid leukemia, GM-CSF)
- Gastrointestinal loss
	- Diarrhea, vomiting, hyperaldosteronism
- Urinary loss
	- Hyperaldosteronism, diuretics, RTA types 1 and 2
- Sweat loss
	- Extreme exercise in hot climate
