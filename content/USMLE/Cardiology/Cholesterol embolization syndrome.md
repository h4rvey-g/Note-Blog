Cholesterol embolization syndrome is a condition in which cholesterol crystals dislodge from atherosclerotic plaques and enter the bloodstream, blocking small to medium arteries in various organs.
# Epidemiology

# Etiology
---
- Iatrogenic 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Vascular interventions, e.g., percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)</span>
	- Cardiac surgery

# Pathophysiology
---
[[Atherosclerosis|Atherosclerosis]] → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">rupture of atherosclerotic plaque (most commonly from the aorta) → blockage and inflammation of small to medium arteries by cholesterol crystals → formation of multiple small peripheral, muscular, or visceral emboli → end-organ damage</span>

# Clinical features

	- Necrosis
	- Purpura
	- Blue toe syndrome: ischemia due to small vessel occlusion that manifests as toe discoloration (pulses typically remain palpable as large arteries are unaffected)

- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Signs of CNS involvement</span> (e.g., [[ischemic stroke|ischemic stroke]] or TIA)
- Signs of retinal involvement
	- Hollenhorst plaques on retinal exam
	- Amaurosis fugax

# Diagnostics
---
- CBC with differential
	- Leukocytosis, eosinophilia
	- [[Anemia|Anemia]]
	- Thrombocytopenia
- Renal function tests: ↑ BUN, ↑ creatinine 
- Urine studies: proteinuria, hematuria, eosinophiluria
- Biopsy
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Amorphous, eosinophilic material in the vessel lumen</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Spindle-shaped spaces (cholesterol clefts)</span>![[L26792.jpg|L26792.jpg]]
