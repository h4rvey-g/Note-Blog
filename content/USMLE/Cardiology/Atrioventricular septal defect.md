A defect of atrioventricular valves (i.e., mitral and tricuspid valves) as well as the atrial and/or ventricular septum; previously referred to as endocardial cushion defects.
# Etiology
---
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Strongly associated with [[Down syndrome|Down syndrome]] </span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Association with [[Diabetes mellitus in pregnancy|maternal diabetes]] and [[Obesity and metabolic syndrome|obesity]] has been shown in some studies. </span>
# Pathophysiology 
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Complete form ([[Autism spectrum disorder|ASD]] and [[Ventricular septal defect|VSD]] + single AV valves) → atrial and ventricular left-to-right shunt → excessive pulmonary blood flow and biventricular volume overload → [[pulmonary hypertension|pulmonary hypertension]] and [[heart failure|heart failure]]</span>![[L14174.jpg|L14174.jpg]]
- Partial form ([[Atrial septal defect|ASD]] only) → atrial left-to-right shunt → symptoms that may remain minimal until adulthood
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">In both forms: abnormal AV valve → AV valve regurgitation → in utero heart failure (nonimmune hydrops fetalis) </span>
