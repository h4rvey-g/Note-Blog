# Epidemiology


---
# Etiology
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Most commonly due to [[Acute rheumatic fever|rheumatic fever]]</span>
- Calcification of the mitral valve annulus
- Degenerative [[Aortic valve stenosis|aortic stenosis]]
	- Degenerative calcific deposits most commonly develop in the mitral valve annulus <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">in women over age 60 and generally do not impair valve function.</span>

# Pathophysiology


---
# Clinical features
- Auscultation
	- Diastolic murmur heard best at the 5th left intercostal space at the midclavicular line (the apex) 
	- Loud first [[Cardiac auscultation|heart sound]] (S1) 
	- Opening snap
		- A high frequency, early to middiastolic sound, heard after S2
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Occurs when mitral leaflet motion suddenly stops during diastole because the stenosed valve has reached its maximum opening</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">A shorter interval between S2 and opening snap indicates more severe disease;</span> occurs because left atrial pressure is greater than left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP).
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Isovolumetric relaxation phase takes shorter to reach equal pressure with atrium.</span>
