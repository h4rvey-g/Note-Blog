	- [[Nail clubbing|Digital clubbing]]
- Clinical features caused directly by the tumor 
	- Symptoms caused by obstruction
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Dyspnea</span> on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and/or orthopnea
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Dizziness or syncope</span> (patients commonly have a history of multiple syncopes)
		- Palpitations
	- Auscultatory findings
		- Low pitched, middiastolic rumbling murmur over the apex (similar to [[Mitral valve stenosis|mitral stenosis]])
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Early diastolic murmur: “plop” sound related to movement of the tumor</span>
	- Symptoms due to <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">embolization</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Due to tumor fragments passing into the systemic circulation.</span>
