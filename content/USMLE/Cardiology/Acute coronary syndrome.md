# Etiology

# Pathophysiology
## Possibilities
1. Left anterior descending artery (45%): infarction of the anterior wall and anterior septum of the LV
2. Right coronary artery: infarction of the posterior wall, posterior septum, and papillary muscles** of the LV
3. Left circumflex artery: infarction of the lateral wall of the LV
# LV vs RV
| Feature                       | Left Ventricle       | Right Ventricle                                                                 |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Muscle mass**               | High                 | Low                                                                             |
| **Resting oxygen extraction** | High                 | Low                                                                             |
| **Coronary perfusion**        | During diastole only | <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Throughout cardiac cycle</span> |
| **Collateral circulation**    | Less developed       | More developed                                                                  |
| **Ischemic preconditioning**  | Low                  | High                                                                            |

The relatively low systolic pressure of the RV (eg, ≤25 mm Hg) allows for coronary perfusion throughout the cardiac cycle

# Treatment
## Arrythmia 
**Class IB [[Antiarrhythmic drugs|antiarrhythmics]]** treat ventricular arrhythmias, especially in ischemic tissue (e.g. **post-MI**)
>[!note] 
>**Ischemia leads to slow cellular depolarization that inactivates sodium channels, and therefore enhanced binding of IB drugs**.

*Usually due to right coronary artery occlusion.

**Usually due to left anterior descending artery occlusion

## 0–24 hours post-infarction
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Sudden cardiac death (SCD)</span>
	- Definition: A sudden death presumably <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">caused by cardiac arrhythmia or hemodynamic catastrophe</span>, which occurs either <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">within an hour of symptom onset</span> in patients with cardiovascular symptoms, or within 24 hours of being asymptomatic in patients with no cardiovascular symptoms. 
	- Pathophysiology: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Fatal ventricular arrhythmia</span> is considered to be the underlying mechanism of SCD. 
	- Underlying conditions
		- [[Coronary artery disease|Coronary artery disease]]: present in ∼ 70% of cases in adults over 35 years 
		- [[Dilated cardiomyopathy|Dilated cardiomyopathy]]/[[hypertrophic cardiomyopathy|hypertrophic cardiomyopathy]]
		- Hereditary ion channelopathies (e.g., long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome)
	- Prevention: installation of the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator device 
- Arrhythmias: a common cause of death in MI patients in the first 24 hours 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Sinus bradycardia is the most common arrhythmia, especially in inferior wall myocardial infarction</span>
		- Due to occlusion of the right coronary artery (RCA).  The RCA usually supplies blood to the sinoatrial node, the atrioventricular node, and most of the bundle of His
