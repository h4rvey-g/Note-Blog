- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Direct arteriolar vasodilators</span>
	- Mechanism
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Increase the release of [[Signal transduction|cGMP]]</span> → relaxation of smooth muscle → vasodilation → ↓ afterload
	- Agents
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hydralazine</span>
			- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hydralazine is a treatment option in pregnant patients.</span>
		- Minoxidil

>[!warning] 
>In patients with long-standing hypertension, a chronic autoregulatory shift in the blood pressure–flow relationship occurs, affording less perfusion (flow) at any given pressure.  <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Therefore, excessively rapid correction of blood pressure toward normal may induce relative ischemia.</span>

# Complications

## Eyes
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hypertensive retinopathy</span>
	- Arteriosclerotic and hypertension-related changes of the retinal vessels 
	- Initial reactive vasoconstriction (vasospasm), followed by sclerosis with breakdown of blood-retinal barrier and subsequent hemorrhage and exudation
	- Fundoscopic examination
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Cotton wool spots</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Retinal hemorrhages (i.e., flame-shaped hemorrhages)</span>![[Pasted image 20241205163937.png|Pasted image 20241205163937.png]]
		- Microaneurysms
		- Macular star (results from exudation into the [[Eye and orbit|macula]])
		- Hard exudates
		- Arteriovenous nicking: a tapering of a retinal venule at the point where a retinal arteriole crosses the retinal venule
			- Marked swelling and prominence of the optic disk with indistinct borders due to papilledema and optic atrophy (end-stage disease) 
		- The presence of papilledema in a hypertensive patient may indicate a [[Hypertensive crises|hypertensive crisis]] and warrants urgent lowering of blood pressure
