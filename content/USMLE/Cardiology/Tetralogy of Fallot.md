# Clinical features
---
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Tet spells: intermittent hypercyanotic, hypoxic episodes with a peak incidence at 2–4 months after birth</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Associated with psychological and physical stress (e.g., crying, feeding, defecation)</span>
	- Caused by either an <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">increase in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR)</span> or a decrease in systemic vascular resistance (SVR) → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">low SVR:PVR ratio allows the deoxygenated right ventricular output to take the low-resistance route to the systemic circulation</span>, leading to acute hypoxemia ("Tet spell").
	- Spells occur suddenly and are potentially lethal.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Untreated children tend to squat</span>
	- Squatting → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↑ SVR</span> → ↓ right-to-left shunt → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↑ blood flow to pulmonary circulation</span> → ↓ hypoxemia → relief of symptoms
- Cardiac examination findings
	- Harsh systolic ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border 
	- Single S2
	- Possible RV heave and systolic thrill

# Treatment
---
- Ductal-dependent CHDs: a group of CHDs that require the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">patent ductus arteriosus (PDA)</span>, which supplies either pulmonary or systemic circulation, to sustain life until surgery can be performed 
	- PDA supplies systemic circulation in the following:
		- Transposition of the great arteries
		- Hypoplastic left heart syndrome
		- [[Coarctation of the aorta|Coarctation of the aorta]]
	- PDA supplies pulmonary circulation in the following:
		- Tricuspid atresia
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Treatment: administration of prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) infusion</span>
		- Example: IV alprostadil infusion
		- Mechanism of action: prevents the ductus arteriosus from closing, creating an intentional shunt to allow mixing of deoxygenated with oxygenated blood
