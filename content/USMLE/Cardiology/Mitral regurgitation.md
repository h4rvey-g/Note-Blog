# Epidemiology

# Etiology
---
- Primary MR (organic): mitral regurgitation caused by direct involvement of the valve leaflets or chordae tendinae 
	- Degenerative mitral valve disease ([[mitral valve prolapse|mitral valve prolapse]], mitral annular calcification, ruptured chordae tendinae)
	- [[Acute rheumatic fever|Rheumatic fever]]
	- [[Infective endocarditis|Infective endocarditis]]
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Secondary MR (functional): caused by changes of the left ventricle that lead to valvular incompetence</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[Coronary artery disease|Coronary artery disease]] or prior myocardial infarction causing papillary muscle involvement </span>
		- This results in hypokinesis and outward displacement of the papillary muscle, creating increased tension on the attached chordae tendineae and preventing complete closure of the corresponding mitral valve cusp.
	- [[Dilated cardiomyopathy|Dilated cardiomyopathy]] (e.g., peripartum cardiomyopathy) and left-sided [[heart failure|heart failure]]
