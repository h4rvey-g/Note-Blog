- Description
	- Rare, noninfective form of endocarditis due to <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">sterile platelet thrombus formation</span> on the heart valves (<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">usually mitral and aortic valves</span>)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Libman-Sacks endocarditis: a type of noninfective endocarditis with verrucous vegetations in individuals with [[systemic lupus erythematosus|systemic lupus erythematosus]] or [[antiphospholipid syndrome|antiphospholipid syndrome]]</span>
- Etiology
	- Malignancy (e.g., pancreatic adenocarcinoma)
	- Hypercoagulable states
	- Underlying trauma (e.g., from indwelling vascular catheters)
	- Previous [[Acute rheumatic fever|rheumatic fever]]
	- Autoimmune conditions (e.g., [[systemic lupus erythematosus|systemic lupus erythematosus]], [[rheumatoid arthritis|rheumatoid arthritis]], [[antiphospholipid syndrome|antiphospholipid syndrome]]) 
	- Chronic infections (e.g., TB, [[pneumonia|pneumonia]], osteomyelitis)
- Clinical features
	- Valves and cardiac function are rarely impaired.
	- Compared to [[Infective endocarditis|Infective endocarditis]], vegetations are <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">easily dislodged and embolization is common</span>, leading to hemorrhages under the nails, skin, and retina
	- Most affected individuals are asymptomatic until embolization occurs.
- Diagnostics
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Negative blood cultures</span>
	- Biopsy: sterile vegetations on either surface of the valve composed of immune complexes, mononuclear cells, and thrombi interwoven with fibrin strands
