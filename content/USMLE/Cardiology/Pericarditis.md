# Etiology
---
- Idiopathic
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Infectious</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Most commonly viral (e.g., coxsackie B virus) </span>
	- Bacterial (e.g., Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., or M. [[tuberculosis|tuberculosis]])
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Myocardial infarction</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Postinfarction fibrinous pericarditis: within 1–3 days as an immediate reaction</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Dressler syndrome: weeks to months after an acute myocardial infarction</span>
- Postoperative (postpericardiotomy syndrome): due to blunt or sharp trauma to the pericardium
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Uremia: e.g., due to acute or chronic renal failure</span>
- Radiation
	- Exudative pericarditis: develops acutely during or after [[radiation therapy|radiation therapy]]
	- Constrictive pericarditis: develops several years after [[radiation therapy|radiation therapy]]
- Neoplasms (e.g., [[Hodgkin lymphoma|Hodgkin lymphoma]])
- Autoimmune connective tissue diseases (e.g., [[rheumatoid arthritis|rheumatoid arthritis]], systemic lupus, [[Systemic sclerosis|scleroderma]])
- Trauma

# Clinical features
---
- Pleuritic chest pain (↓ when sitting up) ± fever
- Pericardial friction rub
- ECG: diffuse ST-segment elevation
- [[Pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade|Pericardial effusion]] on echocardiogram

ECG features of pericarditis
Not all patients go through all stages and manifestations may vary. In particular, pericarditis due to uremia may not involve characteristic ECG changes. 
Stage 1: <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">diffuse ST elevations, ST depression in aVR and V1, PR segment depression </span>
Stage 2: ST segment normalizes in ∼ 1 week.
Stage 3: inverted T waves
Stage 4: ECG returns to normal baseline (as prior to onset of pericarditis) after weeks to months.

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">In contrast to myocardial infarction, pericarditis is characterized by a diffuse distribution of ST elevations on ECG.See also “Differential diagnoses of ST elevations on ECG.”</span>

- First, the diffuseness of the ST elevations (I, II, III, aVF, V3-V6). In myocardial infarction the ST elevations tend to be localized (inferior, anterior, posterior, lateral), often, but not always with reciprocal ST depressions.
- Second, the PR segment displacement which has been attributed to subepicardial atrial injury.
