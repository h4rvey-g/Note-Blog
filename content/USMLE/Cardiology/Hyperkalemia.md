- Potassium excess: due to altered K+ metabolism or intake
	- Reduced excretion: acute and chronic kidney disease 
	- Endocrine causes: hypocortisolism, hypoaldosteronism 
	- Drugs: potassium-sparing diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, NSAIDs, and <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</span> 
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Especially in HIV patients who are taking high-dose TMP-SMX</span>
		- Similar to the actions of amiloride, trimethoprim blocks the epithelial sodium channel in the distal tubule and collecting duct.  This reduces transepithelial voltage and impairs sodium-potassium exchange, leading to reduced potassium excretion and hyperkalemia.
	- Type IV renal tubular acidosis
	- Increased intake
		- High potassium diet, e.g., fresh fruits, dried fruits and legumes, vegetables, nuts, seeds, bran products, milk, and dairy products
		- K+ containing IV fluids
- Extracellular shift
- Extracellular release
