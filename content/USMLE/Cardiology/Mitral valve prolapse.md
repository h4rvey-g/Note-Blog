- The most common underlying pathology in the case of mitral valve prolapse is <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">myxomatous degeneration (deposition of glycosaminoglycan such as dermatan sulfate) of the mitral valve due to a primary disease or connective tissue disorder</span>
	- Long, floppy mitral valve leaflets with excessive valvular tissue → the mitral annulus becomes dilated and the chordae tendineae become elongated (and may rupture) → prolapse of one or both mitral valve leaflets into the left atrium during systole

- Any activity that decreases the left ventricular volume (e.g. standing) will exaggerate the tendency for prolapse. Thus the click and the murmur moves closer to S1.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Any activity that increases the left ventricular volume (e.g. squatting) will decrease tendency for prolapse. Thus the click and the murmur moves close to S2, or not happen at all.</span>
