# Epidemiology
---


# Etiology
---
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[Atherosclerosis|Atherosclerosis]] (∼ 90% of cases): occurs more often in men > 50 years of age; increased risk in smokers </span>
- [[Fibromuscular dysplasia|Fibromuscular dysplasia]] (∼ 10% of cases): mostly affects women < 50 years of age

# Pathophysiology
---
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Narrowing of one or both renal arteries</span> → obstruction of renal blood flow → ischemia → renin release and activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system → hyperreninemic [[Primary hyperaldosteronism|hyperaldosteronism]] (increased renin → increased angiotensin → increased aldosterone) → increased sodium retention and peripheral vascular resistance → renovascular hypertension (secondary hypertension) 
- Prolonged renal hypoperfusion → chronic stimulation of the juxtaglomerular apparatus to secrete renin → hyperplasia of the juxtaglomerular apparatus 
- No improvement in renal blood flow → ischemic renal injury → renal insufficiency and progressive renal atrophy (unilateral or bilateral depending on laterality of RAS) 

# Clinical features
---
- Family history of hypertension is often absent.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hypertension: severe (i.e., resistant to therapy)</span> and/or early-onset (i.e, hypertension in individuals < 30 years of age) 
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Abdominal bruit</span> heard over the flank or epigastrium: present during both systole and diastole 
- Flash pulmonary edema
- Features of [[atherosclerosis|atherosclerosis]] in other parts of the body (e.g., peripheral artery disease, [[coronary artery disease|coronary artery disease]], carotid stenosis)

# Diagnostics
---
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">New-onset or worsening of renal dysfunction (↑ serum creatinine) after initiating ACE inhibitors or ARBs</span>
	- ACE inhibitors and ARBs can induce or worsen renal insufficiency, particularly in patients with severe bilateral renal artery stenosis or high-grade unilateral stenosis.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Unexplained renal atrophy or asymmetry of > 1.5 cm between the kidneys</span>
- Unexplained acute pulmonary edema
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">DDx: [[Fibromuscular dysplasia|Fibromuscular dysplasia]]</span>
