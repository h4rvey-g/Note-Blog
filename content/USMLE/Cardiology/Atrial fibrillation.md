# Etiology


---
# Pathophysiology
- The new onset of Afib triggers a vicious circle that can <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">ultimately lead to long-standing Afib with atrial remodeling:</span>
	1. Afib is triggered by one or both of the following
		- Bursts of electrical activity from automatic foci near the pulmonary vein ostia (left atrium) or in diseased, fibrotic atrial tissue 
		- Pre-excitation of the atria as a result of aberrant pathways (e.g., WPW syndrome)
	2. Afib is sustained by re-entry rhythms and/or rapid focal ectopic firing 
		- Re-entry rhythms are more likely to occur with enlarged atria, diseased heart tissue, and/or aberrant pathways (e.g., WPW syndrome).
	3. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Atrial remodeling</span>
		- Electrophysiological changes in the atria occur within a few hours of Afib onset (electrical modeling).
		- If Afib persists, atrial fibrosis and dilatation (structural remodeling) occur within a few months.
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Electrical and structural remodeling increase susceptibility to Afib, resulting in a vicious circle.</span>
- Effects of Afib
	- The atria contract rapidly but ineffectively and in an uncoordinated fashion → stasis of blood within the atria, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">especially in atrial appendage</span> → risk of thromboembolism and stroke![[L26184.jpg|L26184.jpg]]
	- Irregular activation of the ventricles by conduction through the AV node → tachycardia

# Diagnostics
## ECG
### QRS complex
- Typically narrow QRS complex (< 0.12 seconds)
- Wide QRS complex may be seen in some situations:
	- Aberrant conduction, e.g., bundle branch block or preexcitation (as seen in Afib with WPW)
	- Complete AV block with a ventricular escape rhythm
	- [[Ashman phenomenon|Ashman phenomenon]]: intermittent aberrant ventricular conduction results in isolated or short runs of wide QRS complexes![[Pasted image 20230825210145.png|Pasted image 20230825210145.png]]

>[!warning] 
>Wide QRS complex may indicate preexcited Afib or aberrant conduction.

# Treatment
- First-line
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[Beta blockers|Beta blockers]]</span>: e.g., metoprolol, atenolol, propranolol
		- Via blockade of sympathetic tone
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Work well both during rest and exercise</span>
		- Preferred when Afib is due to [[hyperthyroidism|hyperthyroidism]] and in pregnant patients
		- Avoid in patients with [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|COPD]] and acute decompensated [[heart failure|heart failure]] (ADHF).
	- OR nondihydropyridine [[calcium channel|calcium channel]] blockers (ndHP [[Calcium channel blockers|CCBs]]): e.g., diltiazem, verapamil
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Work well both during rest and exercise</span>
		- Avoid in patients with ADHF. 
		- Can be safely used in [[heart failure|heart failure]] with preserved normal LV systolic function.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Second-line: [[Cardiac glycosides|digoxin]]</span>; preferred initial therapy for patients with ADHF
	- Via increased parasympathetic tone
	- This mechanism is <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">effective at rest, when sympathetic tone is low, but it poorly controls ventricular rate during exercise</span>, when high levels of sympathetic tone accelerate AV node conduction.
- Third-line: amiodarone; typically reserved for patients in whom all other options have failed
