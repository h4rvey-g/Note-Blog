# Description
- Pathological decrease in the pulse wave amplitude and systolic blood pressure <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">> 10 mm Hg during inspiration</span> 
	- Decrease of intrathoracic pressure during inspiration → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">expansion of vena cava and right atrium</span> → ↑ venous return → ↑ RV filling
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↓ Pericardial compliance (e.g., due pericardial rigidity in constrictive pericarditis) → ↑ bowing of the ventricular septum into the left ventricle → ↓ LV ejection volume → ↓ systolic blood pressure</span>
# Causes
- Constrictive pericarditis
- Cardiac tamponade
- Severe obstructive airway disease ([[asthma|asthma]], [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|COPD]])
- [[Obstructive sleep apnea|Obstructive sleep apnea]]
- [[Croup|Croup]]
