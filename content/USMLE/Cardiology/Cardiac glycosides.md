# Pharmacodynamics
---
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Inhibition of Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase → higher intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> concentration → reduced efficacy of Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchangers → higher intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration</span>![[L24819.jpg|L24819.jpg]]
	- In cardiomyocytes, this leads to increased contractility (positive inotropic effect), reduced velocity of electric conduction (negative dromotropic effect) via AV node depression, and a reduction of the heart rate (negative chronotropic effect) via SA node depression.
	- In neurons of the vagal nerve, this leads to increased velocity of electric conduction, which causes reduced heart rate (via increased vagal tone and a reflexive reduction of sympathetic transmission).

## Risk factors
- Electrolyte imbalances
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[Hypokalemia|Hypokalemia]]: digoxin competes with K<sup>+</sup> for binding to Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase</span>
- Medical conditions
	- Renal failure (reduced digoxin [[Drug clearance|excretion]])
	- Volume depletion (e.g., treatment with [[diuretics|diuretics]])
- Drug interactions
	- Treatment with verapamil, diltiazem, amiodarone, and/or quinidine: These drugs may displace digoxin from tissue binding sites and decrease renal elimination. 
		- Both mechanisms of action lead to increased digoxin serum levels.
## Clinical features
- Acute and chronic poisoning: Symptoms are less obvious in chronic poisoning.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Vagal symptoms: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, anorexia</span>
	- Arrhythmia symptoms: palpitations, syncope, and presyncope 
- Chronic poisoning
	- Confusion, fatigue, lethargy, weakness, and disorientation
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Visual disturbances</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Blurred vision, halos, scotomas, diplopia</span>
		- Photophobia
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Xanthopsia (yellow-tinted vision)</span>
