- Pericardial effusion: an accumulation of fluid in the pericardial space <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">between the parietal and visceral pericardium</span>. May be acute or chronic.
- Cardiac tamponade: a pathophysiological process whereby <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">elevated intrapericardial pressure from a pericardial effusion causes compression of the heart (especially the right ventricle)</span>
# Epidemiology

# Etiology
---
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hemopericardium: accumulation of blood in pericardial space</span>
	- Cardiac wall rupture (e.g., complication of myocardial infarction)
	- Chest trauma (traumatic cardiac tamponade)
	- [[Aortic dissection|Aortic dissection]]
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Serous or serosanguinous pericardial effusion </span>
	- Idiopathic
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[Pericarditis|Pericarditis]] (especially viral</span>, but also fungal, tuberculous or bacterial)
	- Malignancy
	- Postpericardiotomy syndrome

## ECG
- Low voltage complexes and electrical alternans in larger effusions
	- Electrical alternans: consecutive QRS complexes that alternate in height due to the swinging motion of the heart when surrounded by large amounts of pericardial fluid![[Pasted image 20230813220122.png|Pasted image 20230813220122.png]]
>[!tip] 
>Don't confuse this with pulse alternans (beat-to-beat variation in pulse amplitude (ie, systolic blood pressure)), which is most commonly seen in patients with severe LV systolic dysfunction (possibly related to the effect of the Frank-Starling mechanism on the failing ventricle)
