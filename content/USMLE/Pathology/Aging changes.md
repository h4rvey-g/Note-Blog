# Respiratory system

- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Lung compliance increases ("loose, baggy lungs") due to loss of elastin content.  This process resembles mild emphysema and leads to dynamic expiratory airflow obstruction, premature airway closure, and progressive hyperinflation.</span>
- Chest wall compliance decreases ("stiff rib cage") due to degenerative changes (ossification, arthritis) of the sternocostal and costovertebral joints and kyphosis of the thoracic spine.
- Total respiratory system compliance, the combination of lung parenchymal and chest wall compliance, is decreased because the stiffness of the chest wall dominates over the increased laxity of the lung.
# Cardiovascular system
---
- Aortic stiffening
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Elastin replacement with [[collagen|collagen]]</span>
	- ↑ Pulse pressure (isolated systolic HTN)
- Mild concentric LVH
	- Response to cardiomyocyte dropout & ↑ afterload
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↓ left ventricular cavity size and sigmoid-shaped interventricular septum</span>
	- Resting EF, SV & cardiac output maintained
	- ↓ Maximal cardiac output
- Conduction cell degeneration
	- Slightly ↓ resting heart rate
	- ↓ Maximal heart rate
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Reduced baroreceptor sensitivity & adrenergic responsiveness</span>
	- ↑ Orthostasis
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↓ Heart rate & contractility response</span>
- Formation of <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">lipofuscin deposits</span> within cells. See [[Cellular adaptations|Cellular adaptations]]
# Skin
---
- Senile purpura: recurrent, irregularly shaped, dark purple macules 
	- Progressive loss of connective tissue, subcutaneous fat, and blood vessel elasticity → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">extravasation of blood into the dermis</span>
# Nervous system
---
- Presbyopia
	- Pathophysiology: age-related <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">decrease in lens elasticity, strength of ciliary muscle, and lens curvature</span> → decreased lens accommodation (focusing on an object up close)
# Beers criteria

Common medications to avoid in older adults
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Anticholinergic (cause urinary retention and constipation)</span>
	- First-generation [[antihistamines|antihistamines]]
		- Also has strong sedative effect
	- Gastrointestinal antispasmodics
- Cardiovascular (may elevate the risk of orthostatic hypotension)
	- Alpha-1 blockers (as antihypertensives)
	- Centrally acting alpha-2 agonists
	- Many [[Antiarrhythmic drugs|antiarrhythmics]]
- CNS (can cause sedation, cognitive impairment, and/or [[delirium|delirium]] → ↑ risk of falls and fractures)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Tricyclic [[antidepressants|antidepressants]]</span>
	- [[Antipsychotics|Antipsychotics]]
	- Barbiturates, [[Sedative-hypnotic drugs|benzodiazepines]] & other hypnotics
- Endocrine (increased risk of [[hypoglycemia|hypoglycemia]])
	- Long-acting sulfonylureas
	- Sliding-scale insulin
		- Doses are not consistent
- Pain (risk of GI bleeding and [[Acute kidney injury|AKI]])
	- Nonselective [[Non-opioid analgesics|NSAIDs]]
	- Skeletal muscle relaxants
