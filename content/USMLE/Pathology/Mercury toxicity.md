- Sources of exposure
	- Organometallic methylmercury in fish
- Clinical features
	- Acute toxicity
		- Gastroenteritis (bloody [[diarrhea|diarrhea]])
		- Kidney failure
		- Inflammation of the airways (from inhalation exposure)
	- Chronic toxicity (Minamata disease) 
		- Cardiovascular/sympathetic nervous system:  Mercury <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">inactivates</span> catechol O-methyltransferase, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">an enzyme responsible for catecholamine breakdown</span>.  Therefore, mercury toxicity leads to increased serum and urinary epinephrine and [[Neurotransmitters|norepinephrine]], causing excess stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system (<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">similar to pheochromocytoma</span>).  Symptoms include <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">diaphoresis, tachycardia, hypertension, and anxiety.</span>
		- Neuropsychiatric:  Mercury can <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">cross the blood-brain barrier and deposit in the CNS</span>, specifically the cerebral cortex, leading to a range of <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">psychiatric and motor symptoms (eg, personality changes, insomnia, tremor)</span>; photophobia may also be seen.
		- Dermatologic:  Mercury toxicity, particularly in children, can lead to a <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">hypersensitivity rash</span> (acrodynia).  A diffuse, pruritic body rash or a desquamating, pink rash on the palms and soles is characteristic.
