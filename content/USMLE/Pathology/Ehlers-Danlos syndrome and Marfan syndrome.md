# Etiology
## Marfan syndrome
- Mutation of <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">fibrillin-1 gene (FBN1)</span> on chromosome 15 → defective fibrillin (a glycoprotein that forms a supportive sheath around elastin) → defective connective tissue microfibrils → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">defective elastin</span>
- Autosomal dominant inheritance pattern with variable penetrance
>[!Mnemonic] 
>Mar<font color="#ffc000">F</font>an syndrome is caused by a gene mutation in <font color="#ffc000">F</font>BN1 on chromosome 15 (<font color="#ffc000">F</font>ifteen), resulting in defective <font color="#ffc000">F</font>ibrillin protein.
## Ehlers-Danlos syndrome
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Mutations in genes (e.g., COL5A1, COL3A1) that control the synthesis and processing of different types of [[collagen|collagen]]</span> → [[collagen|collagen]] defects (e.g., a defect in lysine-hydroxylysine cross-linking of tropocollagen leads to unstable [[collagen|collagen]] fibrils)![[Pasted image 20240120153115.png|Pasted image 20240120153115.png]]

# Pathology

- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Cystic medial degeneration</span>: a degeneration (necrosis) of large blood vessels such as the aorta. 
	- Seen in disorders that cause increased arterial wall stress (e.g., hypertension, [[coarctation of the aorta|coarctation of the aorta]]) as well as connective tissue disorders (especially MFS and EDS)
	- Can lead to aortic aneurysm and [[aortic dissection|aortic dissection]]
