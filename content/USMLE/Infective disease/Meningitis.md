# Epidemiology


---
# Etiology
## Bacterial
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Neisseria meningitidis (First peak: &lt; 2 years of age; second peak: 16–20 years of age)</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[Streptococcus pneumoniae|Streptococcus pneumoniae]] (most common in adults >20 and elders)</span>
### Most common causative agents of bacterial meningitis by age group and underlying condition
- Immunocompromise
	- [[Listeriosis|Listeria monocytogenes]]
	- [[Streptococcus pneumoniae|Streptococcus pneumoniae]]
	- [[Haemophilus influenzae|Haemophilus influenzae]] type b
	- Gram-negative bacilli (e.g., Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp.)
## Other etiologies
- Viral meningitis: often associated with encephalitis (meningoencephalitis)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Enteroviruses (especially coxsackieviruses and echoviruses): the most common cause of all types of meningitis in all patient groups</span>
	- [[Herpesviruses|Herpesviruses]]: HSV (meningitis is more commonly caused by HSV2 than HSV1)

# Pathophysiology
## Pathways of infection
- Most pathogens that cause meningitis <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">colonize the nasopharynx or the upper airways before entering the CNS</span> via:
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hematogenous dissemination</span>
		- About 5–10% of the US adult population are colonized with Neisseria meningitidis.<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)"> The bacteria attach to the nasopharyngeal mucosa</span>, where they can persist for long periods of time. Hematogenous dissemination may then occur subsequent to mucosal infiltration facilitated by infection with another pathogen capable of infiltrating the mucosa, e.g., adenovirus.![[L42361.jpg|L42361.jpg]]
	- Contiguous spread of infections in nose, eyes, and ears
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Retrograde transport along or within peripheral or cranial nerves</span>
		- E.g. Naegleria fowleri via CN I, see below
	- Direct infection (e.g., due to trauma or head surgery)

# Subtypes and variants
---
## Primary amebic meningoencephalitis
- Pathogen: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Naegleria fowleri (colloquially referred to as “brain-eating amoeba”), found in warm freshwater (e.g., ponds, hot springs)</span>
- Route of infection: via <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">contaminated water entering the nose</span> (e.g., while swimming) → invades the CNS directly via the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">olfactory nerve</span> (perforates the cribriform plate) 
- Clinical features: causes <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">fulminant meningoencephalitis with rapid onset</span>
- Diagnosis
	- CSF analysis 
		- Findings similar to those of <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">bacterial meningitis</span> (e.g., neutrophilic pleocytosis, hypoglycorrhachia, increased CSF protein)
		- CSF erythrocytosis (due to hemorrhagic necrosis)
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Microscopy shows trophozoites</span>
- Treatment: [[Antifungals|amphotericin B]], miltefosine
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Prognosis: nearly always fatal</span>
