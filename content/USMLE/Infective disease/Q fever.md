# Etiology
---
## Pathogen
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Coxiella burnetii</span> (gram-negative, intracellular)
	- Morphological similarities to Rickettsia
	- Can survive in harsh environments in a spore-like form
## Route of transmission
- Direct infection (no vector transmission)
- Vector transmission: primary reservoir are cattle, sheep, and goats 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Inhalation of spore-containing aerosols from the amniotic fluid or secretions of infected livestock </span>
	- Ingestion of raw milk produced by infected animals 
## Risk groups
- Slaughterhouse workers, farmers, shepherds, veterinarians

# Clinical features

- Flu-like symptoms, which last for 1â€“2 weeks
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">High-grade fever</span>, chills, malaise, myalgia
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Headache</span>, retroorbital pain, photophobia
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Atypical pneumonia</span>: generally mild with nonproductive cough and fever
