- Route of transmission
	- Oral ingestion: The oocysts are excreted in the feces of cats (final host) and are orally ingested by other mammals such as humans, hoofed animals, and birds (intermediate hosts). Primary modes of transmission include the following:
		- Cat feces
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Raw or insufficiently cooked meat (most common)</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Unpasteurized milk (especially goat milk)</span>
	- Transplacental transmission: see toxoplasmosis in pregnancy
	- Via organ transplantation or blood transfusion
