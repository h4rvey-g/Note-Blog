# Epidemiology

# Etiology
---
- HIV is considered tropic for a certain cell type, depending on whether it preferentially binds to CCR5 or CXCR4 for viral entry, as follows:
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">R5 virus uses CCR5 for viral entry and is considered macrophage-tropic because CCR5 is expressed in high concentrations on both macrophages and lymphocytes.  R5 is the predominant HIV type.</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">X4 virus uses CXCR4 for viral entry and is considered T lymphotropic because CXCR4 is expressed primarily on T lymphocytes but only minimally on macrophages.</span>
- HIV trophism is determined by a gene sequence in the variable (V3) region of the env gene, which encodes for the HIV surface glycoprotein 120.  This glycoprotein mediates viral attachment to the CD4 receptor and chemokine coreceptor.

# Clinical features

## Acute HIV infection
- Also referred to as <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">acute retroviral syndrome</span> (ARS) or described as a <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">mononucleosis-like syndrome </span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Fever</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Fatigue</span>
	- Myalgia and arthralgia
	- Headache
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Generalized nontender lymphadenopathy </span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Generalized rash </span>
	- Gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, diarrhea, weight loss)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Oropharyngeal symptoms (sore throat, ulcerations, painful swallowing)</span>

>[!tip] 
>Acute retroviral syndrome is associated with <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">extremely high levels of viral replication</span> (~5 million copies/mL) as the cell-mediated and humoral antibody response against the virus is <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">not yet fully activated</span>.  
>Therefore, laboratory results during this period usually <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">show evidence of HIV in the plasma (positive viral load and p24 antigen) with a negative serologic response (negative HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody).</span>
>This is referred to as the "window period," as patients are infected with HIV but HIV antibody screening tests may be negative (newer screening tests incorporate testing for HIV p24 antigen and are more sensitive in early infection).

# Diagnostics

## Serological assays
![[L17426.jpg|L17426.jpg]]
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">HIV antibody assays (i.e., third-generation and below): Detect IgM and IgG antibodies.</span>
	- Laboratory methods
		- Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA)
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibody differentiation immunoassay</span>
			- Laboratory-based test that can differentiate between HIV-1 and HIV-2 (provides separate results for each analyte)
			- Most commonly used confirmatory test in the US
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Western blot: Detects only IgG antibody to HIV-1</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Combination HIV antibody with HIV antigen test (i.e., fourth-generation and above): Can detect HIV IgG and IgM antibodies and p24 antigen.</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Cannot differentiate between HIV-1 and HIV-2 infection</span>
