# Etiology
---
## Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
- Virulence factors and resistances
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Cord factor: arranges M. tuberculosis in a serpentine cord → ↑ TNF-α release and activation of macrophages → granuloma formation</span>
	- Surface glycolipids: (sulfatides) inhibit phagolysosomal fusion
	- Infiltration of nonactivated macrophages → escape of humoral immune response 
	- Multi-drug resistance: mutation in KatG (catalase-peroxidase) → INH conversion to its active metabolite → INH resistance

# Pathophysiology
---
## Primary tuberculosis
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Ghon focus: a granuloma typically located in the middle/lower lung lobes.</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Ghon complex: formed by the Ghon focus, regional lymph node, and the linking lymphatic vessels</span>
- The organisms can remain dormant in a walled-off Ghon complex for many years before reactivating.
- Alternatively, the lesion may <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">heal</span>, forming a benign, calcified <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Ranke complex</span> that is <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">not associated with reactivation tuberculosis.</span>
## Secondary tuberculosis
- In < 10% of individuals with primary TB, the host immune response fails to control the infection, leading to active primary TB and progressive disease.
- In > 90% of individuals, the host immune response can control the infection, resulting in latent TB infection. Weakening of host immune response can allow reactivation of disease (or, less commonly, reinfection) and further disease progression.

## Side effects of antituberculosis agents
- Isoniazid
	- Asymptomatic elevation of transaminases 
	- [[Cytochrome P450|Cytochrome P450]] inhibition: leading to interactions with numerous drugs, including antiretroviral agents, cardiovascular agents, and antibiotics
	- Less common
		- [[Drug-induced lupus erythematosus|Drug-induced lupus]]
		- [[Vitamin B6|Vitamin B6]] deficiency: [[sideroblastic anemia|sideroblastic anemia]], peripheral neuropathy 
		- CNS toxicity: precipitation of benzodiazepine-refractory seizures with high doses of isoniazid, psychosis, ataxia 
		- Others: anion gap metabolic acidosis, pellagra, optic neuritis
- Rifampin
	- [[Cytochrome P450|Cytochrome P450]] induction: leading to important interactions with ART in patients with [[Human immunodeficiency virus|HIV]] (therefore, rifabutin is preferred) 
	- Orange discoloration of body fluids
- Pyrazinamide	
	- Greatest hepatotoxicity potential
	- [[Gout|Hyperuricemia]]
- Ethambutol	
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Optic neuritis (reversible red-green color blindness)</span>
