# Epidemiology
---


# Etiology
---
## Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
- Virulence factors and resistances
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Cord factor: arranges M. tuberculosis in a serpentine cord → ↑ TNF-α release and activation of macrophages → granuloma formation</span>
	- Surface glycolipids: (sulfatides) inhibit phagolysosomal fusion
	- Infiltration of nonactivated macrophages → escape of humoral immune response 
	- Multi-drug resistance: mutation in KatG (catalase-peroxidase) → INH conversion to its active metabolite → INH resistance

# Pathophysiology
---
## Primary tuberculosis
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Ghon focus: a granuloma typically located in the middle/lower lung lobes.</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Ghon complex: formed by the Ghon focus, regional lymph node, and the linking lymphatic vessels</span>
- The organisms can remain dormant in a walled-off Ghon complex for many years before reactivating.
- Alternatively, the lesion may <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">heal</span>, forming a benign, calcified <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Ranke complex</span> that is <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">not associated with reactivation tuberculosis.</span>
## Secondary tuberculosis
- In < 10% of individuals with primary TB, the host immune response fails to control the infection, leading to active primary TB and progressive disease.
- In > 90% of individuals, the host immune response can control the infection, resulting in latent TB infection. Weakening of host immune response can allow reactivation of disease (or, less commonly, reinfection) and further disease progression.

# Clinical features

# Diagnostics
---
## Active TB infection
- **Acid-fast bacilli smear microscopy**
	- **Description**: Ziehl Neelsen stain or auramine rhodamine stain are used.
	- **Advantages**:
		- Rapid detection
		- Inexpensive
	- **Disadvantages**:
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Low sensitivity</span>
		- Cannot differentiate *M. tuberculosis* from other nontuberculous mycobacteria
		- Both viable and nonviable mycobacteria will stain
- **<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Nucleic acid amplification test</span>**
	- **Description**: For initial testing (along with AFB smear microscopy and culture) if clinical suspicion is high. Used for confirmation of AFB positive smears.
	- **Advantages**:
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">High specificity and sensitivity (lower sensitivity in individuals with a negative AFB smear)</span>
		- Rapid diagnosis
		- Rapid detection of drug-resistant strains
		- Low cross-reactivity with nontuberculous mycobacteria
	- **Disadvantages**:
		- Requires laboratory equipment and trained staff, which may make use in resource-limited settings more difficult
		- Both viable and nonviable mycobacteria are detectable
- **Culture**
## Latent TB infection
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Tuberculin skin test</span> (purified protein derivative test, Mantoux test)
	- Mechanism
		- Tests cell-mediated immunity against M. tuberculosis via<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)"> delayed hypersensitivity reaction ([[Type IV hypersensitivity reaction|type IV HSR]]) mounted by T cells</span>
	- Does not differentiate between active and latent TB
	- False positives resulting from either of the following:
		- Prior BCG [[vaccination|vaccination]]
		- Exposure to nontuberculous mycobacteria
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">False negatives</span> are possible in patients with any of the following:
		- [[Sarcoidosis|Sarcoidosis]] 
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Immunosuppressed state (anergy)</span>
- [[Interferons|Interferon]]-γ release assay (IGRA)
	- Mechanism
		- Tests cell-mediated immunity against <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">M. tuberculosis-specific antigens by measuring the amount of [[Interferons|IFN-γ]] released by T cells</span> using ELISA![[Pasted image 20241106173104.png|Pasted image 20241106173104.png]]
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Preferred test in individuals with prior BCG vaccination</span>
		- Uses antigens that are found only in _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_, but not in BCG

## Rifamycins
- Mechanism of action: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">inhibits bacterial DNA-dependent RNA-polymerase → prevention of transcription (mRNA synthesis)</span> → inhibition of bacterial protein synthesis → cell death (bactericidal effect)
## Isoniazid (INH)
- Mechanism of action
	- Isoniazid is a <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">prodrug</span> and needs to be converted into its active metabolite <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">by bacterial catalase-peroxidase (encoded by KatG).</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Prevents cell wall synthesis by inhibiting the synthesis of mycolic acid </span>
## Pyrazinamide
- Mechanism of action
	- Not completely understood
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Prodrug</span>: converted into active form pyrazinoic acid
		- Most effective at acidic pH (e.g., in acidic phagolysosomes)
	- Bactericidal effect
## Ethambutol
- Mechanism of action: inhibits arabinosyltransferase → ↓ carbohydrate polymerization → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">prevention of mycobacterial cell wall synthesis (bacteriostatic effect)</span> 
## Side effects of antituberculosis agents
- Isoniazid
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Asymptomatic elevation of transaminases </span>
		- In 10%-20% of patients, INH causes acute, mild hepatic dysfunction
		- In rare instances (<1%), INH induces a <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">frank hepatitis that causes a syndrome similar to viral hepatitis (eg, fever, anorexia, nausea, jaundice)</span>
	- [[Cytochrome P450|Cytochrome P450]] inhibition: leading to interactions with numerous drugs, including antiretroviral agents, cardiovascular agents, and [[antibiotics|antibiotics]]
	- Less common
		- [[Drug-induced lupus erythematosus|Drug-induced lupus]]
		- [[Vitamin B6|Vitamin B6 deficiency]]: [[sideroblastic anemia|sideroblastic anemia]], peripheral neuropathy
			- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Isoniazid is structurally similar to pyridoxine (vitamin B6)</span>, a cofactor for enzymes involved in synthesis of certain neurotransmitters. Because of this similarity, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">isoniazid acts as a competitive inhibitor of pyridoxine and can cause dose-related peripheral neuropathy (eg, numbness and tingling in the hands and feet).</span>
		- CNS toxicity: precipitation of [[Sedative-hypnotic drugs|benzodiazepine]]-refractory [[Seizures and epilepsy|seizures]] with high doses of isoniazid, psychosis, ataxia 
		- Others: anion gap metabolic acidosis, [[Vitamin B3|pellagra]], optic neuritis
- Rifampin
	- [[Cytochrome P450|Cytochrome P450]] induction: leading to important interactions with ART in patients with [[Human immunodeficiency virus|HIV]] (therefore, rifabutin is preferred) 
	- Orange discoloration of body fluids
- Pyrazinamide	
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Greatest hepatotoxicity potential</span>
