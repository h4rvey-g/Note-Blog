## Tick paralysis
- Definition: a rare syndrome caused by the salivary neurotoxin of certain ticks, characterized by acute ataxia, that progresses to ascending paralysis
- Distribution: most commonly in the Rocky Mountains and northwestern US
- Pathophysiology
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Paralysis is caused by tick neurotoxin, which is produced in the tick's salivary gland and introduced into the person's blood.</span>
- Clinical features
	- Symptoms begin within 2â€“7 days of the initial tick bite.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Typically starts with weakness in the lower extremities</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Escalates to ascending flaccid paralysis that progresses rapidly and can lead to respiratory failure due to respiratory muscle weakness</span>
	- Sensory deficits are usually absent.
	- Cranial nerve palsies may occur (e.g., [[Oculomotor nerve palsy (III)|CN III palsy]]).
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">No fever or rash</span>
- Treatment
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Locate and remove the tick</span>
		- Removal of ticks usually results in improvement within 1 hour w/ recovery after several days
