# Etiology
---
## Pathogen
- Actinomyces are primarily anaerobic, gram-positive, non-acid fast, branching, rod-shaped bacteria.![[Pasted image 20230807151234.png|Pasted image 20230807151234.png]]
## Predisposing factors
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Cervicofacial actinomycosis (most frequent form of actinomycosis)</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Poor dental hygiene (e.g., dental caries) </span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Oral surgery (e.g., tooth extraction)</span>
	- Maxillofacial trauma
	- Local tissue inflammation (e.g., tonsillitis, tumor)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Comorbidities (e.g., [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]])</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Abdominal and pelvic actinomycosis</span> (See [[Pelvic inflammatory disease|PID]])
	- Intestinal surgery 
	- Foreign body ingestion
	- Tumor
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Ascending infection from the uterus, associated with intra-uterine contraceptive devices</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Thoracic actinomycosis</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">History of aspiration</span>
	- Recent oral infection
# Clinical features
---
- Cervicofacial actinomycosis 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Slowly progressive mass in the neck and/or face; most commonly in the mandible region</span>
	- Usually <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">painless nodular lesions</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Becomes indurated with purulent discharge that contains **sulfur granules**  from fistulae and draining sinus tracts.</span>![[Pasted image 20240320110002.png|Pasted image 20240320110002.png]]
		- Sulfur granules refer to macroscopic grains – approx. 1 mm in diameter – of <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">hard clumps of bacterial filaments, pus, debris, and hyaline</span>. The granules appear yellow within pus, although despite the name they do not contain sulfur.
- Thoracic actinomycosis
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Cough, chest pain</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Possible hemoptysis with yellow granules</span>

>[!tip] 
>Definitive diagnosis is based on the identification of actinomycotic sulfur granules or bacteria.

>The nonkeratinized, multilayered squamous epithelium of the oral mucosa can be seen (yellow overlay). There are multiple basophilic Actinomyces conglomerates (green overlays), which are surrounded by acute inflammatory cells (red hatched overlay). These conglomerates are palpable externally and visible macroscopically.

>An aggregate of basophilic bacteria with radially branching filaments is visible at the center, which has a cauliflower-like appearance (yellow overlay).  
The bacteria are surrounded by numerous granulocytes, resulting in a lesion with a rosette-like pattern (green overlay).

This is the typical histopathological appearance of a yellow “sulfur granule” caused by actinomycosis.
