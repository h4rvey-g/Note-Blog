# Prevention of intravascular catheter-related infections (CLABSIs and CRBSIs)
---
- Procedural
	- Consider a peripherally inserted central line (PICC). ![[Pasted image 20241129093834.png|Pasted image 20241129093834.png]]
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Use of subclavian or internal jugular insertion sites (femoral vein has a higher risk of infection)</span>
	- For the procedure:
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Perform skin preparation with chlorhexidine and alcohol.</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Follow hand hygiene and strict aseptic technique. </span>
		- Place the line under ultrasound guidance. 
- Postprocedural
	- Replace lines that were inserted emergently within 2 days. 
	- Perform regular maintenance.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Routine replacement of CVCs is not necessary</span> for functional catheters with no evidence of infection.
