# Epidemiology

# Etiology
---
TSS is most commonly caused by toxin-producing strains of [[Streptococcus pyogenes|Streptococcus pyogenes]] and [[Staphylococcus aureus|Staphylococcus aureus]]
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Staphylococcal TSS</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Menstrual factors (∼ 50% of cases)</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">High-absorbency tampons</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Prolonged placement of tampons, menstrual cups, and vaginal sponges</span>
	- Nonmenstrual factors
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Burn and wound infections</span>
		- Postpartum or postabortion infections
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Postsurgical wound packing</span>

# Pathophysiology
---
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Superantigen production</span>: Causative organisms (S. pyogenes and S. aureus) produce superantigens
- Superantigen-mediated T-cell activation 
	- Superantigens bypass processing and presentation by antigen-presenting cells.
	- Superantigens directly connect the MHC class II molecule on antigen-presenting cells to the T-cell receptor on T-cells by forming a bridge outside of the normal binding sites → nonspecific T-cell activation → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">rapid activation of excessive numbers of T cells</span> → massive cytokine release 
- SIRS: ↑↑↑ Cytokines → generalized endothelial disruption → capillary leak syndrome → generalized edema → intravascular hypovolemia → organ dysfunction and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)

# Clinical features
---
## Prodrome 
- Flu-like symptoms: high fever, chills, myalgia, headache, nausea, vomiting, [[diarrhea|diarrhea]]
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Dermal rash: more common in menstrual staphylococcal TSS</span> than in nonmenstrual staphylococcal TSS and streptococcal TSS 
	- Transient erythematous macular (<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">sunburn-like</span>) rash
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Commonly involves the palms and soles </span>
	- Typically desquamates 1–2 weeks after onset.  
## Shock and end-organ dysfunction 
- Early: tachycardia, tachypnea, high fever, altered mental status 
- Late
	- Hypotension
	- Delayed capillary refill
	- Worsening altered mental status
	- Evidence of organ failure
