# Pathophysiology
<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Botulinum toxin: protease that cleaves SNARE proteins and prevents fusion of transmitter-containing vesicles with the presynaptic membrane → inhibition of acetylcholine release from the presynaptic axon terminals</span>
>[!tip] [[Tetanus|Tetanus]] vs botulism
>Both work on SNARE proteins![[Pasted image 20240726161637.png|Pasted image 20240726161637.png]]

# Clinical features
---
- Neurological symptoms
	- Descending paralysis
		- Peripheral flaccid muscle paralysis that descends caudally (typically begins in frequently used muscles)
		- Pupils: accommodation paralysis, mydriasis, diplopia
		- Pharynx: dysarthria, dysphagia
	- Infantile hypotonia (see “Infant botulism” below)
- Gastrointestinal symptoms
	- Gastrointestinal discomfort, nausea, and vomiting, later followed by constipation
# Foodborne botulism
- Etiology
	- Ingestion of preformed botulinum toxin via contaminated foods 
		- The anaerobic spores survive in <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">poorly pasteurized canned foods (e.g., vegetables with soil contact, meat, home-fermented tofu)</span>
		- Germination of the spores produces dangerous toxins (botulinum toxins = enterotoxins A-F) and gas → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">bulging cans</span>
# Infant botulism
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Etiology: ingestion of spores</span> 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Spores may be present in honey, juice, and contaminated soil.</span>
	- Germination of the spores in intestinal tract → synthesis of botulinum toxin
		- A mature immune system destroys spores before they can colonize the intestinal tract. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Because the immune system is underdeveloped in the first year of life</span>, the bacteria are able to colonize and produce the toxin inside an infant's intestinal tract following ingestion.
- Incubation period: days to 4 weeks
- Clinical features: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Infants may present with infantile hypotonia</span> 
	- Age <12 months
	- Constipation, poor feeding, hypotonia
	- Oculobulbar palsies (eg, absent gag reflex, ptosis)
	- Symmetric, descending paralysis
