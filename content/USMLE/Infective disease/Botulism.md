# Pathophysiology
<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Botulinum toxin: protease that cleaves SNARE proteins and prevents fusion of transmitter-containing vesicles with the presynaptic membrane → inhibition of acetylcholine release from the presynaptic axon terminals</span>

# Infant botulism
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Etiology: ingestion of spores</span> 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Spores may be present in honey, juice, and contaminated soil.</span>
	- Germination of the spores in intestinal tract → synthesis of botulinum toxin
		- A mature immune system destroys spores before they can colonize the intestinal tract. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Because the immune system is underdeveloped in the first year of life</span>, the bacteria are able to colonize and produce the toxin inside an infant's intestinal tract following ingestion.
- Incubation period: days to 4 weeks
- Clinical features: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Infants may present with infantile hypotonia</span> 
	- Age <12 months
	- Constipation, poor feeding, hypotonia
	- Oculobulbar palsies (eg, absent gag reflex, ptosis)
	- Symmetric, descending paralysis
