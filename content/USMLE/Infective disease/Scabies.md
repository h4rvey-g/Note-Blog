# Epidemiology

# Etiology

# Pathophysiology
---
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">The fertilized, female mite tunnels into the superficial skin layer ([[Skin layers|stratum corneum]]), forming burrows in which she lays her eggs and deposits feces (scybala).</span>
- After 2 months, the female parasite dies on site.
- Following a period of 3 weeks, the larvae mature into adult mites, maintaining the infestation cycle.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">The excretions of the mites and their decomposing bodies contain antigens which cause an immunological response (see [[type IV hypersensitivity reaction|type IV hypersensitivity reaction]]), presenting as severe pruritus and excoriations. </span>

# Clinical features
---
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Intense pruritus that increases at night</span>
	- The name "scabies" comes from "scratch"
	- A warm bed or bath intensifies the pruritus because the mite becomes more active.
- Skin lesions
	- Burrows of 2â€“10 mm in length![[Pasted image 20240409213629.png|Pasted image 20240409213629.png]]
- Predilection sites 
	- Wrists (flexor surface)
	- Medial aspect of fingers
	- Interdigital folds (hands and feet)
	- Male genitalia (e.g., scrotum, penis)
	- All other intertriginous areas of the skin (anterior axillary fold, buttocks)

# Diagnostics
---
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Detection of mites, larvae, ova, or mite feces</span>
	- Revealed in dermoscopy ![[Pasted image 20240409213744.png|Pasted image 20240409213744.png]]
	- Microscopic examination of the skin 
	- Skin scraping and histology

# Treatment
---
- Drug of choice: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">permethrin</span> 5% lotion
- Alternatives
	- Oral ivermectin: especially indicated in large outbreaks or severe forms of scabies
