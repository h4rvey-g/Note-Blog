# Epidemiology

# Etiology
---
- Pathogen
	- Rabies is caused by several different members of the Rhabdoviridae family.
	- Rhabdoviruses are rod or bullet shaped
	- Genus: Lyssavirus
	- ssRNA
- Transmission
	- Most common animal reservoir worldwide: dogs 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Most common animal reservoirs in the US: bats</span>, raccoons, skunks, and foxes
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Spread through saliva of rabid animal after bite injury</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Via aerosols (e.g., bat caves); rare</span>

# Pathophysiology
---
Rabies virus binds the ACh receptor of peripheral nerves in the bite wound → migrates retrogradely along the axonal microtubules (using motor protein dynein) → enters the CNS → infects the brain

# Clinical features
---
## Encephalitic rabies (most common type)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hydrophobia: Rabies patients experience involuntary, painful pharyngeal muscle spasms when trying to drink; later on in the disease, the sight of water alone may provoke nausea or vomiting. </span>
- CNS symptoms
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Anxiety, agitation</span>, and combativeness alternating with calm periods
	- Confusion and hallucinations
	- Photophobia
	- Fasciculations
	- Seizures
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↑ Muscle tone and reflexes with nuchal rigidity</span>
- Autonomic symptoms (e.g., hypersalivation, hyperhidrosis)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Coma and death within days to weeks of the development of neurological symptoms</span> 
## Paralytic rabies (< 20% of cases)
- Flaccid paralysis, gradually ascending and spreading from bite wound
- Paraplegia and loss of sphincter tone
- Respiratory failure and death 

# Diagnostics
---
- Postmortem brain tissue autopsy
	- Histopathological findings: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Negri bodies (eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusion bodies typically found in the cerebellum and hippocampus)</span>
