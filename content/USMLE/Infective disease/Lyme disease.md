## Stage II (early disseminated Lyme disease)
Symptom onset occurs 3â€“10 weeks after a tick bite
- Migratory arthralgia; can progress to Lyme arthritis if left untreated
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Early neuroborreliosis</span>
- Lyme carditis
- Cutaneous manifestations
	- Multiple erythema migrans lesions
### Neuroborreliosis
- Onset
	- Early neuroborreliosis: within the first few months after a tick bite; typically has an acute onset
	- Late neuroborreliosis: months to years after the initial infection; typically has an indolent onset
- Peripheral neuropathy: weakness, pain, paresthesia
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Cranial neuropathy: most commonly facial nerve palsy (often bilateral)</span>
	- Radiculitis, plexopathy, mononeuropathy, or mononeuritis multiplex
- Meningitis: can cause benign intracranial hypertension
- Encephalitis, myelitis, or encephalomyelitis
## Lyme arthritis
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Onset: weeks to years after the initial infection</span>
- Prodrome of migratory arthralgia: can occur in early disseminated Lyme disease
	- Affects joints at different times; typically involves the bursae and tendons at onset
	- Can progress to Lyme arthritis if left untreated
- Lyme arthritis: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">typically occurs in late disseminated Lyme disease</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Monoarthritis or asymmetric oligoarthritis</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Typically affects the large joints (especially the knee or elbow)</span>
	- May be intermittent or persistent
