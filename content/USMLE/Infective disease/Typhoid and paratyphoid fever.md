- Pathogen 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi: typhoid fever</span>
		- Gram-negative rod
		- Facultative anaerobe with peritrichous flagella
		- Produces hydrogen sulfide (H2S) on TSI agar
		- Oxidase-negative
		- Cannot ferment lactose
	- Salmonella enterica serotype Paratyphi: paratyphoid fever
- Reservoir
	- Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi: humans
	- Other Salmonella species: humans and animals
- Transmission: fecal-oral
# Pathophysiology
---
## Lifecycle
1. Oral uptake of pathogen: A relatively large number of organisms (∼ 105) is needed to cause infection (high infective dose), unlike, e.g., in Shigella infection, where as few as ∼ 10 organisms suffice to infect the host.
2. Migration into the Peyer patches of the distal ileum: If the pathogen manages to reach the distal ileum, it migrates via M cells through the epithelium and into the Peyer patches.
3. Infection of macrophages  → nonspecific symptoms
4. Spread from macrophages to the bloodstream → septicemia → systemic disease
5. Migration back to intestine → excretion in feces

# Clinical features
---
## Week 1
- Body temperature rises gradually. 
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Relative bradycardia (not seen in children)</span> 
	- Physiologically, the heart rate increases in proportion to body temperature (for every degree Fahrenheit, the heart rate should increase ∼ 10 beats/min). In typhoid fever, this physiological response is typically reduced. Thus, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">the heart rate is only moderately increased despite a high fever</span>, which is known as relative bradycardia.
- Constipation or diarrhea
