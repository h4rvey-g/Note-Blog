# Pathophysiology
---
## Lifecycle
1. Oral uptake of pathogen: A relatively large number of organisms (∼ 105) is needed to cause infection (high infective dose), unlike, e.g., in Shigella infection, where as few as ∼ 10 organisms suffice to infect the host.
2. Migration into the Peyer patches of the distal ileum: If the pathogen manages to reach the distal ileum, it migrates via M cells through the epithelium and into the Peyer patches.
3. Infection of macrophages  → nonspecific symptoms
4. Spread from macrophages to the bloodstream → septicemia → systemic disease
5. Migration back to intestine → excretion in feces
