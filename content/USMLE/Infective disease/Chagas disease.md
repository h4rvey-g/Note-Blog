# Epidemiology

# Etiology
---
- Pathogen: Trypanosoma cruzi  
- Route of infections
	- Vector transmission
		- Numerous triatomine species of the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Reduviidae family</span> (also called <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">kissing bug because it typically bites around the mouth</span>)
			- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">They hide in the cracks of houses and usually bite individuals in their sleep.</span>
		- T. cruzi is shed in the feces of the reduviid bug; feces is then rubbed into the bite site while scratching. 

# Pathophysiology

# Clinical features
---
- Acute phase
	- Cutaneous manifestations
		- Chagoma: inflammatory edema at the bite site (usually in the face)
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Romana sign: unilateral painless edema of the eyelids and periocular tissue</span> 
			- Romana sign is seen when the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">portal of entry of T. cruzi is the conjunctiva.</span> Patients may also present with ipsilateral conjunctivitis and preauricular lymph node enlargement.


# Diagnostics
---
Best initial test: direct visualization of T. cruzi trypomastigotes in thin and thick peripheral blood smears using a Giemsa stain![[L13837.jpg|L13837.jpg]]
