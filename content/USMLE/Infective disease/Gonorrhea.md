# Disseminated gonococcal infection (DGI)
---
## Etiology
Hematogenous spread of N. gonorrhoeae from an untreated mucosal gonococcal infection
## Clinical features
<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">DGI typically manifests as gonococcal arthritis without symptoms of a localized mucosal infection.</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Arthritis-dermatitis syndrome</span> 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Polyarthralgias</span>: migratory, asymmetric arthritis that can become purulent 
	- Tenosynovitis: simultaneous inflammation of several tendons (e.g., in the fingers, toes, wrists, ankles) 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Dermatitis</span>
		- Vesicular, pustular, or maculopapular lesions, possibly with a necrotic or hemorrhagic center 
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Distribution: acral (i.e., the extensor surfaces of the hands and feet, sometimes involving the palms and soles), the trunk</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Purulent gonococcal arthritis</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Abrupt monoarticular or oligoarticular inflammation</span>
	- Commonly affects knees, ankles, elbows, and wrists 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Skin manifestations and tenosynovitis are typically absent.</span>
