# Pathophysiology

- Local infection: imbalance in local flora (e.g., triggered by antibiotic use) → local overgrowth of C. albicans → local mucocutaneous infection (e.g., oropharyngeal infection, vaginitis)
- Systemic (invasive) infection: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">local mucocutaneous infection → breach of skin/mucosal barrier or translocation (IV catheterization, ascending infection in pyelonephritis, or resorption via GIT)</span> → direct invasion of bloodstream (candidemia) → spread to visceral tissues → disseminated organ infection (e.g., pyelonephritis, endocarditis)
