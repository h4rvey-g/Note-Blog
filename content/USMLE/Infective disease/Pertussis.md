- Proliferation of Bordetella pertussis <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">on ciliated epithelial cells of the respiratory mucosa → production of virulence factors (e.g., tracheal cytotoxin) → paralysis of respiratory epithelium cilia and inflammation → secretion of inflammatory exudate into respiratory tract → compromise of small airways → cough, pneumonia, cyanosis</span>
- Bordetella pertussis produces <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">pertussis toxin</span> → ADP-ribosylation of the α subunit of Gi protein → inhibition of Gi protein → adenylate cyclase disinhibition → cAMP accumulation → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">impaired cell signaling pathways → systemic manifestations associated with whooping cough (e.g., hypoglycemia, lymphocytosis, modulation of host immune response)</span>
