# Complications

- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Critical illness [[polyneuropathy|polyneuropathy]] (CIP)</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Definition: axonal injury, particularly to the motor neurons, as a sequela of sepsis and multiple organ dysfunction</span>
	- Clinical features
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Predominantly distal, symmetrical, flaccid paralysis of the extremities with muscle atrophy; may affect the diaphragm</span>
		- Absent or reduced reflexes
		- Dysesthesias in a glove-and-stocking distribution may be present
- Critical illness myopathy (CIM), which results in a decrease of muscle membrane excitability and loss of myosin with resultant atrophy of myofibers
