# Etiology

- Pathogen: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Listeria monocytogenes; a gram-positive, catalase-positive, rod-shaped, facultative intracellular, motile bacterium</span>
- Route of transmission
	- Acquired listeriosis: ingestion of contaminated food <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">(listeria can grow in temperatures as low as -1.5 ºC) </span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Raw milk products</span>
		- Raw and smoked meat/fish
		- Industrially processed vegetables such as ready-made salads
	- Congenital listeriosis 
		- Transplacental transmission during [[pregnancy|pregnancy]]
		- Perinatal transmission (via infected vaginal secretions)
- Incubation time: 1–90 days (usually within a month) 
- Risk factors
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[Congenital immunodeficiency disorders|Immunodeficiency]]</span>

	- Neonates

# Pathophysiology
---
- Listeriolysin O:  This major virulence factor <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">generates pores in phagosome membranes, which allows phagocytosed L monocytogenes to escape into the cytoplasm of monocytes and avoid lysosomal destruction.</span>
- Actin-based transcellular spread:  The organism hijacks the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">actin-based cellular motility mechanism</span> of host cells, which allows it to <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">spread to adjacent cells without reentering the extracellular space.</span>  This significantly reduces exposure of L monocytogenes to antibodies and phagocytic cells.![[Pasted image 20240728201057.png|Pasted image 20240728201057.png]]
- Because of these adaptations, antibody- and phagocyte-mediated destruction of the pathogen is impaired; therefore, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">infections are controlled primarily by the cytotoxic T-cell response.</span>
