# Epidemiology

# Etiology
---
- Pathogen
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Strongyloides stercoralis (threadworm)</span> 
	- Threadworms are nematodes.
- Mode of transmission: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">percutaneous penetration of larvae (primarily via the feet)</span>
- Life cycle 
	- The Strongyloides eggs hatch in the human intestine and release larvae→ larvae are excreted in feces and contaminate the soil→ larvae penetrate the intact skin of the definitive host upon contact with contaminated soil → larvae migrate to the lungs via the bloodstream → larvae migrate to the pharynx via the alveoli and bronchial system → larvae are swallowed, causing autoinfection → larvae mature into adult, egg-producing worms in the intestine → eggs develop into infectious larvae and are excreted in feces 
	- Hyperinfection: Some larvae may penetrate the intestinal wall and enter the bloodstream (rare).

# Clinical features

- Cutaneous phase
	- Swelling, erythema, maculopapular rash at the site of larval penetration
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Larva currens: raised serpiginous lesions or urticarial tracts due to migration of larvae under the skin in autoinfection; pathognomonic of S. stercoralis infection </span>![[Pasted image 20241120185200.png|Pasted image 20241120185200.png]]
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Pruritus</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Pulmonary phase: dry cough and wheezing, hemoptysis</span>, rarely [[pneumonia|pneumonia]] (<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Loeffler syndrome</span>)
- Intestinal phase: inflammation (e.g., duodenitis)
	- Abdominal pain 
	- [[Diarrhea|Diarrhea]]
	- Anorexia, nausea, vomiting
