- Legionnaires' disease: a type of legionellosis that manifests as [[Pneumonia#Atypical pneumonia|Pneumonia > Atypical pneumonia]]
- Pontiac fever: a type of legionellosis that manifests with flu-like symptoms without [[pneumonia|pneumonia]].
# Epidemiology

	- Confined travel accommodations (e.g., cruise ships, hotels, resorts)
# Clinical features
- Incubation period: 2â€“10 days
- Fever, chills, headache
- Severe atypical [[pneumonia|pneumonia]]: dry cough which can become productive, shortness of breath, bilateral crackles
- Relative bradycardia

> Legionnaires' disease should always be considered in patients with signs of atypical pneumonia and diarrhea in combination with possible exposure (e.g., cruise ship travel, use of a whirlpool).
