The enzyme<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)"> thymidylate synthase</span> is responsible for <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">converting deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP) to deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP).</span>  Although most enzymes involved in one-carbon metabolism maintain folate in its active tetrahydrofolate form, thymidylate synthase is unique in that it oxidizes 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate to dihydrofolate.  <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">This makes de novo thymidine synthesis particularly susceptible to folate-deficient conditions because tetrahydrofolate must be continuously regenerated by dihydrofolate reductase.</span>
