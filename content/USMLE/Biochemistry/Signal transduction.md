## Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs)
- Examples of ligands:<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)"> insulin, growth factors</span> (e.g., EGF, IGF, FGF, TGF)![[Pasted image 20240730103015.png|Pasted image 20240730103015.png]]
## Non-receptor tyrosine kinases
- Examples of ligands:<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)"> growth hormone</span>, prolactin, erythropoietin, thrombopoietin, cytokines (e.g., G-CSF, IFN, IL-2, IL-6)
- Activation principle (similar to receptor tyrosine kinases) ![[Pasted image 20240730110153.png|Pasted image 20240730110153.png]]
	1. Ligand binding leads to <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">receptor dimerization</span>.
	2. Two neighboring tyrosine kinase domains of JAK phosphorylate each other (autophosphorylation) → JAK activation
	3. Development (at the phosphorylated tyrosine residues) of binding sites for SH2 domains of signal proteins (STAT proteins). 
	4. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">STAT proteins are phosphorylated and dimerized by JAK.</span>
	5. STAT dimers exert their effect directly in the nucleus as a <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">transcription factor</span> for JAK-STAT regulated genes.

## cAMP (cyclic adenosine monophosphate)  and protein kinase A
- Regulation of adenylyl cyclase: depends on the type of G protein of the G protein-coupled receptor
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Gs proteins: activate adenylyl cyclase → ↑ cAMP</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Gi proteins: inhibit adenylyl cyclase → ↓ cAMP</span>
- Effects
	- cAMP activates protein kinase A (PKA).
	- Mechanism: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">PKA controls the activity (activation or inactivation) of numerous enzymes via phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues.</span>
	- Example: glycogen metabolism to ↑ blood glucose concentration
		- [[Hypoglycemia|Hypoglycemia]] → ↑ glucagon or adrenaline → GPCR activation → ↑ cAMP → activation of PKA, which causes:
			- Phosphorylation of glycogen phosphorylase → activation → increased mobilization of glucose from glycogen
			- Phosphorylation of glycogen synthase → inhibition→ decreased glycogen formation
- Degradation
	- cAMP is degraded by phosphodiesterase to adenosine monophosphate (AMP).
- Examples of ligand hormones
	- Hypothalamic hormones: GHRH, CRH, vasopressin (V2 receptor)
	- Pituitary hormones: TSH, ACTH, FSH, LH, MSH
	- Other hormones: PTH, [[calcitonin|calcitonin]], glucagon, histamine (H2 receptor), [[Human chorionic gonadotropin|hCG]]
## cGMP (cyclic guanosine monophosphate)
- Synthesis: cGMP is synthesized from GTP by the guanylate cyclase. There are two subforms of guanylate cyclase:
	- Soluble guanylate cyclase: activated by <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">nitric oxide</span>
	- Membrane-bound guanylate cyclase: activated through extracellular ligand binding (e.g., EDRF, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">ANP, BNP</span>)

>[!tip] 
>Both lead to vasodilation.
- Effects
	- Activates cGMP-dependent protein kinase G in smooth muscle cells → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">inhibits Ca2+ outflow from the sarcoplasmic reticulum → ↓ intracellular Ca2+ → relaxed smooth vascular muscles → vasodilation</span>
	- cGMP-dependent ion channels in the photoreceptor cells of the retina → preserve the unstimulated state → dark signal
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Degradation: by phosphodiesterase</span> to GMP
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">So [[Phosphodiesterase inhibitors|PDE inhibitors]] work as vasodilators, used in the treatment of [[pulmonary hypertension|pulmonary hypertension]] (PDE-4 inhibitor roflumilast) and erectile dysfunction (PDE-5 inhibitor sildenafil).</span>
## IP3 and DAG
- Synthesis![[Pasted image 20240404172938.png|Pasted image 20240404172938.png]]
	1. Activation of a Gq protein-coupled receptor
	2. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Activation of phospholipase C</span> (an enzyme that cleaves phospholipids) 
	3. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Cleaving of the membrane-bound phospholipids PIP2</span> (phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate) into the second messenger <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">IP3</span> (inositol triphosphate) and <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">DAG</span> (diacylglycerol)
- Function
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">IP3</span> (hydrophilic) diffuses into the cytoplasm → activation of IP3 receptors at the membrane of the [[endoplasmic reticulum|endoplasmic reticulum]] (ER) → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Ca2+ release from the ER</span> via the IP3 receptor-coupled [[calcium channel|calcium channel]] → ↑ intracellular Ca2+ concentration → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">smooth muscle contraction</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">DAG</span> (lipophilic) remains in the membrane → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">activates protein kinase C (PKC)</span> 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">PKC is Ca2+-dependent (depends on IP3-mediated Ca2+ release)</span>
- Mechanism of action: regulates the activity of various enzymes via phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues, e.g., regulatory proteins that influence cell growth (actin [[cytoskeleton|cytoskeleton]]) or differentiation (EGFR)
- Examples of the effect of PKC: cell growth and proliferation
- Examples of ligands: vasopressin (V1 receptor), oxytocin, GnRH, TRH, angiotensin, gastrin, histamine (H1 receptor)
## Ca2+ as a second messengers
- Effect of Ca2+, especially as a complex with calmodulin: One molecule of calmodulin binds up to four Ca2+ ions → conformational change → regulation of calmodulin-dependent kinases/phosphatases, e.g., CaM kinase III (protein synthesis)
