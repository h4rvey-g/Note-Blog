Definition: inherited genetic disorder characterized by the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">impaired break down of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA)</span>
# Epidemiology


---
# Etiology
autosomal recessive

---
# Pathophysiology
- Absent or deficient branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase → impaired degradation of BCAA (valine, leucine, isoleucine) → elevated α-ketoacid formation![[Pasted image 20231117163430.png|Pasted image 20231117163430.png]]

# Clinical features
- Symptom onset: early neonatal period
- Vomiting, lethargy, poor feeding
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Sweet-smelling urine (maple syrup or burnt sugar odor)</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Intellectual disability</span>
- Dystonia
- Damage to the CNS can be severe (elevated leucine level leads to brain injury)
- Death may occur without appropriate treatment

# Diagnostics
- Serum
	- Increased levels of alpha-ketoacids (especially leucine alpha-ketoacids)

---
# Treatment
- Avoid foods containing BCAA
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Supplementation of [[Vitamin B1|thiamine]], a cofactor of branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase</span>
