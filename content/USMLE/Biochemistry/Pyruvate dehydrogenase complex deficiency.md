  - Pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency
share: true

- Definition: inherited genetic disorder characterized by impaired [[pyruvate metabolism|pyruvate metabolism]]
- Inheritance: X-linked recessive or autosomal recessive
- Pathophysiology
	- Why is it called pyruvate dehydrogenase? Because it takes the hydrogen from carbon and thus oxidizing it.![[Pasted image 20240223102745.png|Pasted image 20240223102745.png]]
	- Absent pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">impaired conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA</span> → reduced production of citrate → impaired citric acid cycle → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">energy deficit (especially in the CNS) → neurological dysfunction</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Excess pyruvate is further metabolized in the [[Catabolism of amino acids|Cahill cycle]] to the following</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Lactate via lactate dehydrogenase</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Alanine via alanine aminotransferase</span>
- Clinical features
	- Onset: early neonatal period
	- Poor feeding, lethargy
	- Tachypnea
	- Developmental delay
	- Progressive neurological symptoms (e.g., [[Seizures and epilepsy|seizures]])
- Diagnostics
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↑ Lactate (lactic acidosis) and pyruvate in serum</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↑ Alanine in serum and urine</span>
- Treatment
	- Acute: correction of acidosis
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Long-term: ketogenic diet</span>
		- High in fat, low in carbohydrates
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">High in ketogenic amino acids (lysine and leucine) </span>
		- Avoidance of glucogenic acids (e.g., valine)
	  - <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Avoid glucogenic amino acids: [[Methionine|Methionine]], histidine, valine.</span>
