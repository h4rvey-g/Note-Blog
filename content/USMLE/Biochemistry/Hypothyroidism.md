# Epidemiology

# Etiology
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Primary hypothyroidism: insufficient thyroid hormone production</span>
	- [[Hashimoto thyroiditis|Hashimoto thyroiditis]]
		- The most common cause of hypothyroidism in iodine-sufficient regions
		- Associated with [[HLA system|HLA-DR3]] and other autoimmune diseases (e.g., [[vitiligo|vitiligo]], pernicious anemia, type 1 [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes mellitus]], and [[systemic lupus erythematosus|systemic lupus erythematosus]])
	- Postpartum thyroiditis ([[Subacute thyroiditis|subacute lymphocytic thyroiditis]]) 
	- [[Subacute thyroiditis|De Quervain thyroiditis]] ([[Subacute thyroiditis|subacute granulomatous thyroiditis]]): often subsequent to a flu-like illness
	- Iatrogenic: e.g., post thyroidectomy, radioiodine therapy, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">antithyroid medication (e.g., amiodarone, lithium)</span>
	- Nutritional (insufficient intake of iodine): the most common cause of hypothyroidism worldwide, particularly in iodine-deficient regions
	- [[Riedel thyroiditis|Riedel thyroiditis]]: occurs in IgG4-related systemic disease
	- Wolff-Chaikoff effect
	- Thyroid dysplasia: a disorder of embryologic development characterized by abnormal development and/or location of thyroid tissue (e.g., lingual thyroid)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Secondary hypothyroidism: pituitary disorders (e.g., [[pituitary adenoma|pituitary adenoma]]) → TSH deficiency</span>
- Tertiary hypothyroidism: hypothalamic disorders → TRH deficiency

# Clinical features
- Symptoms related to decreased metabolic rate
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hair loss (Queen Anne sign), brittle nails, and cold, dry skin</span>
- Symptoms related to generalized myxedema
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hoarse voice, difficulty articulating words</span>
- Symptoms of <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[hyperprolactinemia|hyperprolactinemia]]</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Abnormal menstrual cycle (esp. secondary [[amenorrhea|amenorrhea]] or menorrhagia)</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Galactorrhea </span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Decreased libido</span>, erectile dysfunction, delayed ejaculation, and infertility in men

# Treatment
Hypothyroidism is treated with lifelong hormone substitution.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Levothyroxine: synthetic form of T4</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">First-line choice</span> for the treatment of hypothyroidism
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Peripherally converted to T3</span> (biologically active metabolite) and rT3 (biologically inactive metabolite)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Liothyronine: synthetic form of T3</span>
	- Part of the treatment for myxedema coma
	- Not recommended as monotherapy or in combination with levothyroxine for the long-term treatment of hypothyroidism
		- Liothyronine has a short half-life and requires three to four daily doses, making it less suitable than levothyroxine for the ongoing treatment of hypothyroidism.

# Congenital hypothyroidism
## Clinical features
- Asymptomatic at birth
- Symptomatic weeks to months after birth (as maternal T4 wanes)
	- Hypometabolism: ↓ HR & temperature, lethargy/poor feeding, hypotonia, constipation, jaundice
	- Mucopolysaccharide accumulation: macroglossia, umbilical hernia
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Cretinism</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Nonpitting edema (eg, "puffy" face), umbilical hernia, protruding tongue, and a large anterior fontanelle</span>
		- Due to <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">accumulation of matrix substances cutaneously and internally</span>

>[!warning] 
>Most children with congenital hypothyroidism <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">do not have symptoms at the time of birth because the placenta supplies the fetus with maternal thyroid hormone.</span> For this reason, neonatal screening is vital even if children are asymptomatic. Irreversible intellectual disabilities can be avoided through early initiation of adequate therapy!

## Diagnostics
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Neonatal screening to measure TSH levels</span> 24–48 hours after birth is required by law.
- Increased TSH levels indicate congenital hypothyroidism.
