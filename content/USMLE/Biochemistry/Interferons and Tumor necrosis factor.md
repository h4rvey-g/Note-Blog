# Overview of Interferons

## Type I Interferons
![[L13801.jpg|L13801.jpg]]
### Interferon Alpha (IFN-α)
- **Mainly Secreted By:**
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Virus-infected cells and malignant cells</span>
	- Fibroblasts (interferon-β)
- **Function:**
	- Acts as the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">first line of defense against all viral infections</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Inhibits viral protein synthesis by activating ribonuclease L, leading to the degradation of cellular and viral mRNA</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Promotes the expression of MHC class I molecules, aiding in the recognition of virus-infected cells and activation of NK cells and cytotoxic T cells</span>
	- Inhibits megakaryocyte stem cell differentiation and proliferation
- **Therapeutic Use:**
	- Chronic [[hepatitis B|hepatitis B]]
	- Acute and chronic [[hepatitis C|hepatitis C]]
	- [[Kaposi sarcoma|Kaposi sarcoma]]
	- Adjuvant therapy for malignant [[melanoma|melanoma]]
	- [[Renal cell carcinoma|Renal cell carcinoma]]
	- Condyloma acuminatum
	- [[Hairy cell leukemia|Hairy cell leukemia]]
	- Essential thrombocythemia
- **Side Effects:**
	- Flu-like symptoms (fever, chills)
	- Depression
	- Myopathy
	- Neutropenia
	- Interferon-induced autoimmunity
	- Gastrointestinal issues (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea)
	- Itchy skin
### Interferon Beta (IFN-β)
- **Therapeutic Use:**
	- [[Multiple sclerosis|Multiple sclerosis]]

## Type II Interferons

### Interferon Gamma (IFN-γ)
- **Mainly Secreted By:**
	- Th1 and NK cells (when stimulated by IL-12 from macrophages or antigen contact)
- **Function:**
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Activates macrophages to increase phagocytosis </span>(positive reinforcement) and NK cells to eliminate virus-infected target cells
	- Synergistic effect with tumor necrosis factor in stimulating macrophages to form granulomas, crucial against mycobacterial infections
	- Suppresses a Th2 response (negative feedback)
	- Promotes the expression of MHC class II molecules and antigen presentation in every cell
	- Stimulates antigen class switching to IgG3 
- **Therapeutic Use:**
	- Chronic granulomatous diseases (e.g., [[leprosy|leprosy]], [[leishmaniasis|leishmaniasis]], toxoplasmosis)

# Tumor Necrosis Factor Superfamily
---
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Pro-inflammatory cytokines</span> secreted by leukocytes in response to inflammation and/or infection
- Their signaling pathways regulate inflammation, apoptosis, and cellular proliferation and differentiation
- There are over 20 tumor necrosis factors, with cachectin and lymphotoxin-alpha being the most important
## Cachectin (Tumor Necrosis Factor, formerly <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">TNF-α</span>)

### Secreted by:
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Activated macrophages</span>
### Functions:
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Pyrogenic</span>
- Cytotoxic and inhibits carcinogenesis of certain tumors
- Mediates septic shock by activating the endothelium, leading to:
    - Vascular leakage
    - Recruitment of white blood cells
- Causes malignant cachexia
- Maintains granulomas, which are critical for defense against mycobacterial infections
### Therapeutic Significance:
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">TNF inhibitors like infliximab are used to treat refractory chronic inflammatory systemic diseases (e.g., Crohn disease)</span>
## Lymphotoxin-alpha (formerly <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">TNF-β</span>)
### Secreted by:
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Activated lymphocytes</span>
### Functions:
- Cytotoxic, leading to inhibition of carcinogenesis
- Promotes colony stimulating factor synthesis, which leads to:
    - Fibroblast proliferation
    - Stimulation of wound healing
### Therapeutic Significance:
- TNF inhibitor etanercept can bind lymphotoxin-alpha
