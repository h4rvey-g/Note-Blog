Definition: a group of inherited genetic disorders characterized by impaired homocysteine metabolism![[Pasted image 20231111104739.png|Pasted image 20231111104739.png]]![[Pasted image 20240404211022.png|Pasted image 20240404211022.png]]
# Epidemiology


---
# Etiology
- Autosomal recessive
- Cause deficiencies in one or more of the following enzymes
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[Methionine|Methionine]] synthase</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Cystathionine synthase</span>: an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of homocysteine and serine to cystathionine, using [[vitamin B6|vitamin B6]] as a cofactor.
	- Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR): an enzyme involved in folate metabolism that reduces N5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate to methyltetrahydrofolate.
- Impaired affinity of cystathionine synthase for pyridoxal phosphate

---
# Pathophysiology
- [[Methionine|Methionine]] synthase (homocysteine methyltransferase) deficiency → impaired conversion of homocysteine into [[methionine|methionine]]
- Cystathionine synthase deficiency → impaired conversion of homocysteine into cystathionine
- All forms result in the accumulation of homocysteine.

# Clinical features
- Nonspecific features in infancy: growth faltering, developmental delay
- Eyes
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Downward and inward subluxation of the ocular lens (ectopia lentis) after 3 years of age (in [[Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and Marfan syndrome|Marfan syndrome]], the lens usually luxates upwards and outwards)</span>![[Pasted image 20231111110428.png|Pasted image 20231111110428.png]]
	- Myopia and [[Glaucoma|glaucoma]] later in life
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Progressive intellectual disability</span>
- Psychiatric and behavioral disorders
- Light skin
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[Marfanoid features|Marfanoid features]]</span>
	- Tall, thin
	- Pectus deformities (e.g., pectus excavatum)
	- Scoliosis
	- Elongated limbs (↑ arm:height ratio; ↓ upper:lower body segment ratio), arachnodactyly
	- Hyperlaxity of joints and hyperelasticity of the skin
 
>[!tip] 
>[[Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and Marfan syndrome|Marfan syndrome]] and homocystinuria both present with [[Marfanoid features|marfanoid habitus]]. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Distinguishing features include intellectual disability, which is only seen in homocystinuria, and the direction of lens dislocation (downwards in homocystinuria and upwards in [[Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and Marfan syndrome|Marfan syndrome]]).</span>
- [[Osteoporosis|Osteoporosis]]
- Cardiovascular complications like thromboembolism, premature [[Atherosclerosis|arteriosclerosis]], and [[Coronary artery disease|coronary heart disease]] increase the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke

---
# Diagnostics
- ↑ Homocysteine in urine and serum
- Urine [[Cyanide poisoning|sodium nitroprusside]] test: Urine changes color to an intense red in the presence of homocysteine.
- Serum [[methionine|methionine]] levels
	- Increased in cystathionine synthase deficiency
	- Decreased in [[methionine|methionine]] synthase deficiency and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency

---
# Treatment
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Some patients respond to large doses of [[Vitamin B6|pyridoxine]] ([[vitamin B6|vitamin B6]]).</span>
- [[Methionine|Methionine]] synthase deficiency: high-[[methionine|methionine]] diet
- Cystathionine synthase deficiency
	- Low-[[methionine|methionine]], high-cysteine diet
	- Supplementation of [[vitamin B12|vitamin B12]] and folate
- Impaired affinity of cystathionine synthase for pyridoxal phosphate: high-cysteine diet
- MTHFR deficiency: supplementation of folate
