# Overview
---
- Definition: genetic syndromes caused by microdeletion (at 15q11-q13) in combination with <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">genomic imprinting</span>.
	- Genomic inprinting: an epigenetic phenomenon that results in <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">silencing of one of the alleles of a gene depending on whether the allele was paternally or maternally inherited.</span>
- Etiology: The resulting condition depends on the affected gene copy. 
	- Angelman syndrome
		- Deletion or mutation of maternal UBE3A (chromosome 15) gene copy and paternal gene methylation (silencing) 
	- Prader-Willi syndrome
		- Deletion or mutation of paternal gene copy and maternal gene methylation (silencing)
- Diagnosis: genetic tests
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)</span>

- Clinical features 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Muscular hypotonia and poor feeding in infants</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Increased appetite (hyperphagia) and [[Obesity and metabolic syndrome|obesity]]</span> 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[Cryptorchidism|Cryptorchidism]], [[hypogonadism|hypogonadism]], genital [[Cellular adaptations|hypoplasia]]</span>
	- Facial dysmorphia (e.g., almond-shaped eyes, thin upper lip)
	- Developmental delays (e.g., delayed achievement of milestones), intellectual disability
	- Behavioral problems (e.g., temper tantrums, stubbornness, obsessive-compulsive behavior)
- Treatment
	- Calorie restriction
	- Substitution of growth hormone and sex hormones
- Complications
	- Sleep apnea (most common)
	- Type 2 [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes mellitus]]
	- Choking episodes 
	- Gastric distention and rupture
