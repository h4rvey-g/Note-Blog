- Definition: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">X-linked disorder with progressive loss of intelligence and cognitive abilities</span> such as language, locomotion, and fine motor skills 
>[!Mnemonic] A kind of regression, like the one in [[Ego defenses|Ego defenses]]

>- The opposite is [[Infantile hemangioma|Infantile hemangioma]], which first progress then regress.
- Etiology: X-linked dominant gene mutation in methyl-CpG binding protein 2 gene (<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">MECP2 gene</span>)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Neuropathology is consistent with arrested brain development</span> (eg, impaired dendritic maturation, reduced neuromelanin in substantia nigra) rather than death of neurons (ie, neurodegeneration).
	- Usually not an inherited gene defect, but rather a sporadic mutation 
	- Mutation usually occurs in the paternal allele; thus, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">females are almost exclusively affected </span>
	- If affected, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">male fetuses die in utero or shortly after birth.</span>
- Clinical features
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Normal development until the first symptoms appear, which typically happens at 6â€“18 months of age</span>
	- Symptoms of neurodevelopmental regression, including:
		- Loss of motor skills, especially targeted hand movements (affected children show characteristic <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">hand wringing</span>)![[Pasted image 20240505102026.png|Pasted image 20240505102026.png]]
		- Truncal ataxia, apraxia, choreatic movements
		- Intellectual and verbal disability
		- [[Seizures and epilepsy|Seizures]]
		- Growth failure
		- Scoliosis
