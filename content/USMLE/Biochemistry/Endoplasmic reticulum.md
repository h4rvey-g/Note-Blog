- **Smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum (SER)**
	- Involved in synthesis and processing of hydrophobic compounds (lipids, phospholipids, cholesterol derivatives)
	- Contains enzymes for steroid and phospholipid biosynthesis (e.g., 21-hydroxylase)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Key in steroidogenesis, particularly in steroid-producing cells (adrenals, gonads, liver)</span>
	- Associated with conditions like virilization due to [[Androgen and estrogen synthesis|androgen]]-secreting tumors and [[paraneoplastic syndromes|paraneoplastic syndromes]]
- **Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum (RER)**
	- Characterized by numerous <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">ribosomes</span> on its outer membrane
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Essential for synthesis and modification of targeted proteins, including secretable polypeptide hormones</span>
