- **Smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum (SER)**
	- Involved in synthesis and processing of hydrophobic compounds (lipids, phospholipids, cholesterol derivatives)
	- Contains enzymes for steroid and phospholipid biosynthesis (e.g., 21-hydroxylase)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Key in steroidogenesis, particularly in steroid-producing cells (adrenals, gonads, liver)</span>
	- Associated with conditions like virilization due to [[Androgen and estrogen synthesis|androgen]]-secreting tumors and [[paraneoplastic syndromes|paraneoplastic syndromes]]
- **Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum (RER)**
	- Characterized by numerous <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">ribosomes</span> on its outer membrane
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">They synthesize secretory proteins</span>, the integral membrane proteins of the nucleus and cell membrane, and proteins within the ER, Golgi network, and lysosomes.
- **Free ribosomes** remain floating in the cytosol throughout protein synthesis.  They are responsible for translating <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">proteins found within the cytosol</span>, nucleosol, peroxisome matrix, and nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins
