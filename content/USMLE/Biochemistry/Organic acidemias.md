- Definition: inherited genetic disorders characterized by impaired metabolism of fats and proteins
- Pathophysiology![[Pasted image 20241029162629.png|Pasted image 20241029162629.png]]
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Propionic acidemia: propionyl-CoA carboxylase deficiency → impaired conversion of propionyl-CoA to methylmalonyl-CoA → ↑ propionyl-CoA and ↓ methylmalonate → conversion into propionic acid, which accumulates in serum and urine</span>
	- Methylmalonic acidemia: methylmalonyl-CoA mutase deficiency or [[Vitamin B12|vitamin B12 deficiency]] → accumulation of methylmalonic acid
		- Methylmalonyl-CoA is transformed into succinyl-CoA by the enzyme methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, which requires adenosylcobalamin, the active form of [[vitamin B12|vitamin B12]], as a cofactor.
	- Accumulation of organic acids leads to
		- [[Urea cycle|Urea cycle]] inhibition → [[hyperammonemia|hyperammonemia]]
		- [[Gluconeogenesis|Gluconeogenesis]] inhibition → [[hypoglycemia|hypoglycemia]] during [[Metabolic fuel use|fasting]] periods and increased risk of ketoacidosis (high anion gap metabolic acidosis)
- Clinical features
	- Most commonly present in infancy with poor feeding, vomiting, hypotonia, high anion gap metabolic acidosis, [[hepatomegaly|hepatomegaly]], [[Seizures and epilepsy|seizures]].
