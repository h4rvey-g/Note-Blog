- Active forms: flavin mononucleotide (FMN), flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)
	- Active forms of ribo<font color="#ffc000">F</font>lavin are <font color="#ffc000">F</font>MN and <font color="#ffc000">F</font>AD.
- Sources: meat, fish, eggs, milk, green vegetables, yeast
# Functions
FAD and FMN are cofactors for enzymes that are involved in redox reactions (chemical reactions in which electrons are transferred from one substance to another), including:
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Succinate dehydrogenase ([[TCA cycle|TCA cycle]])</span>
- FAD is part of glutathione reductase (GR) in erythrocytes: NADPH binds to GR → reduction of FAD to FADH- → FADH- breaks disulfide bond in GSSG → GSR can be reduced
# Vitamin B2 deficiency
- Causes
	- Malnutrition
	- Restricted diet (e.g., vegan, lactose-free)
	- ↑ Demand: pregnancy, lactation
- Clinical features
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Corneal vascularization</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Cheilitis, glossitis, stomatitis</span>, pharyngitis 
	- Normocytic normochromic anemia
	- Seborrheic dermatitis
- Diagnosis
