1. Generation of ammonia in periphery
2. Transportation of ammonia to liver
	1. In periphery
		- Transamination: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">amino acids + α-ketoglutarate ⇄ α-ketoacids + glutamate</span>
	2. Transport to liver, by either
		- Glutamine cycle (most common)
			- Glutamate is negatively charged, it needs to get one more ammonia to form glutamine, to be able to get through membrane
			- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Glutamate + NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> + ATP → Glutamine + ADP + Pi</span>
		- Alanine cycle (Cahill cycle)
			- Similar reason, glutamate gives ammonia to pyruvate to form alanine, to be able to get through membrane. This process is a reversed transamination.
			- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Pyruvate + glutamate ⇄ alanine + α-ketoglutarate</span>
	3. In liver
		- Convert back to glutamate, by either
			- Glutaminase: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">glutamine + H2O → glutamate + ammonium</span>
			- Transamination: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">alanine + α-ketoglutarate ⇄ pyruvate + glutamate</span>
		- Release ammonia (Deamination): <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">glutamate + NAD(P)<sup>+</sup> + H<sub>2</sub>O ⇄ α-ketoglutarate + NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> + NAD(P)H + H<sup>+</sup></span>
3. Excretion of ammonia
	- Urea cycle
# Transamination
---
- Description: transfer of an amino group from an AA to an α-ketoacid for breakdown, or to an α-ketoacid to form a nonessential AA![[Pasted image 20241205095036.png|Pasted image 20241205095036.png]]
- E.g.
	- ALT: 
	- AST: aspartate + α-ketoglutarate ⇄ oxalacetate + glutamate 
# Deamination
---
- Description: reaction in which an amino group from an AA is released as ammonium

1. In the liver, alanine is transaminated by alanine aminotransferase to pyruvate with the amino group being transferred to α-ketoglutarate to form glutamate. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Almost all aminotransferase enzymes use α-ketoglutarate as the amino group acceptor.</span>  
2. Thus, amino groups are funneled into glutamate during protein catabolism.  
3. Glutamate is further metabolized by the enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase, which liberates free ammonia and regenerates α-ketoglutarate.  
4. Ammonia then enters the urea cycle to form urea, the primary disposal form of nitrogen in humans.  
5. Urea subsequently enters the blood and is excreted in the urine.

><span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Lactate/alanine is transported to the liver, where it is converted into glucose. It is then transported back to the muscles for energy production.</span>

# Urea cycle
---
- Location: primarily occurs in the cytosol and mitochondria of liver cells and also in kidney cells

## Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency

![[Pasted image 20231108214221.png|Pasted image 20231108214221.png]]
- Definition: inherited genetic disorder characterized by the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">inability to excrete ammonia</span>
- Epidemiology: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">most common urea cycle defect</span>
- Inheritance: X-linked recessive (in contrast to the rest of urea cycle enzyme deficiencies which are all autosomal recessive)
- Pathophysiology
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Defect in the enzyme ornithine transcarbamylase → impaired conversion of carbamoyl phosphate and ornithine to citrulline (and phosphate) → ammonia cannot be eliminated and accumulates</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Conversion of excess carbamoyl phosphate to orotic acid</span> occurs as part of the pyrimidine synthesis pathway
- Clinical features
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Symptoms commonly manifest in the first days of life but can develop at any age.</span>
	- Nausea, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">vomiting</span>, irritability, poor feeding
	- Delayed growth and cognitive impairment
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">In severe cases, metabolic encephalopathy with coma and death</span>
	- Does not cause megaloblastic anemia (as opposed to orotic aciduria)
- Diagnostics
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[Hyperammonemia|Hyperammonemia]] (usually > 100 μmol/L)</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↑ Orotic acid in urine and blood</span>
	- ↓ BUN
	- ↑ Carbamoyl phosphate and ↓ citrulline in the serum
	- Normal ketone and glucose levels
