| Source                   | Derived from arachidonic acid                                                                                                 | Derived from arachidonic acid                                                                                                 |
| Function                 | Involved in various physiological processes, including inflammation, pain, and regulation of blood flow                       | <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Primarily functions as a vasodilator and inhibits platelet aggregation</span> |
| Types                    | Several types (e.g., PGE2, PGF2Î±)                                                                                             | <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">One main type: PGI2</span>                                                    |
| Receptors                | Multiple receptors (e.g., EP, FP, DP)                                                                                         | Specific receptors (IP receptors)                                                                                             |
| Effects on Blood Vessels | Can cause vasodilation or vasoconstriction depending on the type                                                              | Causes vasodilation                                                                                                           |
| Effects on Platelets     | Can stimulate platelet aggregation (e.g., thromboxane A2)                                                                     | Inhibits platelet aggregation                                                                                                 |
