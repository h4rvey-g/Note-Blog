# Functions
- Cofactor for enzymes:
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[Methionine|Methionine]] synthase: Methylcobalamin is required for the transfer of methyl groups (e.g., in DNA synthesis).</span>![[Pasted image 20231225210715.png|Pasted image 20231225210715.png]]
	- Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (e.g., in odd-chain fatty acid metabolism)![[Pasted image 20231225210648.png|Pasted image 20231225210648.png]]
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hydroxocobalamin (precursor of vitamin B12) is used to treat [[Cyanide poisoning|Cyanide poisoning]]</span>

# Etiology
![[highresdefault_L24633.jpg|highresdefault_L24633.jpg]]
- [[Malabsorption|Malabsorption]]
	- ↓ Intrinsic factor (IF)
		- Atrophic gastritis due to
			- Autoimmune atrophic gastritis: most common cause of vitamin B12 deficiency
			- H. pylori infection
		- Gastrectomy 
	- Reduced uptake of IF-vitamin B12 complex in terminal ileum due to:
		- Alcohol use disorder
		- [[Crohn disease|Crohn disease]], [[celiac disease|celiac disease]]
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Pancreatic insufficiency (e.g. [[Chronic pancreatitis|Chronic pancreatitis]])</span>
			- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Pancreatic proteolytic enzymes are needed to release vitamin B12 from the vitamin B12–R protein complex</span> (R protein is also known as transcobalamin I or haptocorrin), a necessary step that enables vitamin B12 to bind intrinsic factor, which ultimately facilitates terminal ileal absorption.
		- Surgical resection of the ileum
		- Diphyllobothrium latum (tapeworm) infection
		- Bacterial overgrowth
		- Enteritis
		- Achlorhydria
- Malnutrition
	- [[Anorexia nervosa|Anorexia nervosa]]
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Strict [[Vegan diet|vegan diets]]: occurs only after years of a strict diet that excludes all animal products (unlike folate deficiency, which occurs within a few months of insufficient intake)</span>
		- Found almost exclusively in animal products (except yeast extract)
- Increased demand: e.g., during [[pregnancy|pregnancy]], breastfeeding, fish tapeworm (Diphyllobothrium latum) infection, and leukemia
- Drugs: metformin

# Pathophysiology
## Dysfunctional biochemical reactions
- Dysfunctional [[methionine|methionine]] synthase (normally converts homocysteine to [[methionine|methionine]], thereby demethylating N5-methyl-THF to THF) 
	- ↓ Tetrahydrofolate (THF; cofactor in purine synthesis) → ↓ DNA synthesis → large, nucleated hematopoietic cells, including megaloblasts  → megaloblastic precursors undergo apoptosis or are phagocytosed by macrophages → pancytopenia (including megaloblastic anemia)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↓ [[Methionine|Methionine]] → neuropathy</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↑ Homocysteine</span> → endothelial damage → predisposes to cardiovascular disease
	- Can also cause secondary folate deficiency
- Dysfunctional methylmalonyl CoA mutase
	- Methylmalonyl CoA cannot be converted to succinyl CoA → accumulation of methylmalonyl CoA and its precursor propionyl CoA, as well as their associated odd-chain fatty acids, which cannot be completely metabolized
	- Propionyl CoA replaces acetyl CoA in neuronal membranes → demyelination → neurological manifestations
## Pernicious anemia
- A type of vitamin B12 deficiency caused by <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">autoantibodies against [[intrinsic factor|intrinsic factor]] and/or gastric parietal cells</span> (type II hypersensitivity reaction)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Antiparietal cell antibodies: target gastric parietal cells</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Causes ↓ acid production and [[atrophic gastritis|atrophic gastritis]]</span>
			- In turn <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">increases gastrin level</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↓ [[Intrinsic factor|Intrinsic factor]] production → ↓ vitamin B12 absorption in terminal ileum</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Anti-IF antibodies</span>: bind [[intrinsic factor|intrinsic factor]] and block the vitamin B12 binding site
- Associated with other autoimmune diseases (e.g., hypothyroidism, vitiligo)
- Increases the risk of gastric cancer

# Clinical features
- Signs of anemia (e.g., fatigue, pallor) 
- Neurological disturbances are generally symmetrical
	- Peripheral neuropathy: tingling, numbness, pins-and-needles sensation, coldness (especially in the lower extremities)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Subacute combined degeneration of spinal cord: symmetrical demyelination of the spinal cord tracts occurs in vitamin B12 deficiency due to insufficient vitamin B12-dependent fatty acid synthesis and production/maintenance of myelin</span>![[highresdefault_L29069.jpg|highresdefault_L29069.jpg]]
		- It manifests with the following symptoms:
			- Paresthesia, impaired proprioception, loss of vibratory sensation, tactile sensation, and position discrimination due to <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">demyelination of the dorsal columns</span>
			- Spastic paresis due to demyelination of the lateral corticospinal tracts (axons of upper motor neurons)
			- [[Gait|Gait]] abnormalities (spinal ataxia) resulting from the damage of spinocerebellar tracts and dorsal columns, [[Romberg test|Romberg test]] (+)
		- Long-term deficiency can lead to irreversible neurological damage.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Neuropsychiatric disease</span> (e.g.,<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)"> reversible [[dementia|dementia]]</span>, depression, paranoia)
	- Worsening vision 
	- Autonomic dysfunction: impotence and incontinence
- Glossitis

>[!tip] 
>Always consider vitamin B12 deficiency when evaluating patients with [[dementia|dementia]].

# Diagnostics
- If vitamin B12 serum levels are normal:
	- Measure homocysteine: elevated in both vitamin B12 deficiency and folate deficiency
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Measure methylmalonic acid (MMA) to help rule out folate deficiency (MMA is normal in folate deficiency and elevated in vitamin B12 deficiency)</span>
		- Without vitamin B12, methylmalonyl CoA mutase cannot break down methylmalonyl CoA, which leads to the accumulation of MMA.![[Pasted image 20231225210648.png|Pasted image 20231225210648.png]]
