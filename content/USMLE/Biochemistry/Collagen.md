# Structure

- A collagen molecule is a protein with a <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">repeating amino acid sequence (Gly-X-Y)<sub>n</sub>.</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">The first amino acid of this triplet is glycine (collagen is comprised of ⅓ glycine).</span>
	- Position X: most commonly <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">proline</span> (also common: lysine, hydroxylysine)
	- Position Y: most commonly <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">hydroxyproline</span> (also common: hydroxylysine, lysine)

>[!tip]
>- Compare with ligaments, which are made of elastin.
>- Ligaments attach bone to bone, and tendons attach muscle to bone.
>- Connect presence of <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">elastin with [[Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and Marfan syndrome|Marfan syndrome]]</span>
>	- FBN1 can disrupt the normal regulation of TGF-β -> Tall stature
>	- Skin -> Skin hyperextensibility
>	- Large arteries -> aortic dilation, aneurysms, or dissection
>	- Elastic ligaments -> Joint hypermobility
>	- Lung -> Increased risk of spontaneous [[pneumothorax|pneumothorax]]
