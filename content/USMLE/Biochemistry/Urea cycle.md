# Transport of ammonia by alanine

1. In the liver, alanine is transaminated by alanine aminotransferase to pyruvate with the amino group being transferred to α-ketoglutarate to form glutamate. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Almost all aminotransferase enzymes use α-ketoglutarate as the amino group acceptor.</span>  
2. Thus, amino groups are funneled into glutamate during protein catabolism.  
3. Glutamate is further metabolized by the enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase, which liberates free ammonia and regenerates α-ketoglutarate.  
4. Ammonia then enters the urea cycle to form urea, the primary disposal form of nitrogen in humans.  
5. Urea subsequently enters the blood and is excreted in the urine.
