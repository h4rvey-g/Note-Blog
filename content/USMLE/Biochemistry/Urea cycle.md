- Definition: inherited genetic disorder characterized by the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">inability to excrete ammonia</span>
- Epidemiology: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">most common urea cycle defect</span>
- Inheritance: X-linked recessive (in contrast to the rest of urea cycle enzyme deficiencies which are all autosomal recessive)
- Pathophysiology
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Defect in the enzyme ornithine transcarbamylase → impaired conversion of carbamoyl phosphate and ornithine to citrulline (and phosphate) → ammonia cannot be eliminated and accumulates</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Conversion of excess carbamoyl phosphate to orotic acid</span> occurs as part of the pyrimidine synthesis pathway
- Clinical features
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Symptoms commonly manifest in the first days of life but can develop at any age.</span>
	- Nausea, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">vomiting</span>, irritability, poor feeding
	- Delayed growth and cognitive impairment
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">In severe cases, metabolic encephalopathy with coma and death</span>
	- Does not cause megaloblastic anemia (as opposed to orotic aciduria)
- Diagnostics
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[Hyperammonemia|Hyperammonemia]] (usually > 100 μmol/L)</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↑ Orotic acid in urine and blood</span>
	- ↓ BUN
	- ↑ Carbamoyl phosphate and ↓ citrulline in the serum
	- Normal ketone and glucose levels
# Transport of ammonia by alanine

1. In the liver, alanine is transaminated by alanine aminotransferase to pyruvate with the amino group being transferred to α-ketoglutarate to form glutamate. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Almost all aminotransferase enzymes use α-ketoglutarate as the amino group acceptor.</span>  
2. Thus, amino groups are funneled into glutamate during protein catabolism.  
3. Glutamate is further metabolized by the enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase, which liberates free ammonia and regenerates α-ketoglutarate.  
4. Ammonia then enters the urea cycle to form urea, the primary disposal form of nitrogen in humans.  
5. Urea subsequently enters the blood and is excreted in the urine.

><span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Lactate/alanine is transported to the liver, where it is converted into glucose. It is then transported back to the muscles for energy production.</span>

# Catabolism of amino acids
---
- Transamination: transfer of an amino group from an AA to an α-ketoacid for breakdown, or to an α-ketoacid to form a nonessential AA
- Decarboxylation: release of the α-carboxyl group of an AA via splitting of CO2

- ALT: alanine + α-ketoglutarate ⇄ pyruvate + glutamate 
- AST: aspartate + α-ketoglutarate ⇄ oxalacetate + glutamate
