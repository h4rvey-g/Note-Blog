# Zinc function
- Protein structure
	- Forms bonds between cysteine and histidine
	- Forms zinc finger transcription factors
- Aids in maintenance and stability of the nuclear membrane
- Essential part of many enzymes (> 100), including DNA polymerase, carbonic anhydrase, ACE, [[alkaline phosphatase|alkaline phosphatase]], metallothionein, superoxide dismutase, and collagenases
# Zinc deficiency
- Causes
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Inadequate dietary intake</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Acrodermatitis enteropathica: congenital deficiency of the zinc/iron-regulated transporter-like protein (ZIP)  </span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Malabsorption (e.g., due to Crohn disease)</span>, liver, and renal disease
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Total parenteral nutrition</span> (TPN)
	- Chronic liver disease (esp. liver cirrhosis)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Bowel resection</span>
- Clinical features
	- Impaired wound healing
	- Dysgeusia
		- On the upper surface of the tongue, there are taste receptor cells known as "taste buds". These cells regenerate frequently but the activity reduces when zinc is deficient, which causes dysgeusia.
	- Anosmia
	- Immune dysfunction
	- Male hypogonadism
	- Dermatitis
		- Perioral (a) and perianal (b) erythema and pustules can be seen.![[Pasted image 20231013204734.png|Pasted image 20231013204734.png]]
	- [[Alopecia|Alopecia]]
	- In patients with liver cirrhosis: associated with accelerated progression of cirrhosis and aggravated clinical symptoms (e.g., hepatic encephalopathy)
	- Diarrhea
	- Impaired growth and development
- Diagnosis: measurement of plasma zinc levels
- Treatment: oral zinc supplementation
