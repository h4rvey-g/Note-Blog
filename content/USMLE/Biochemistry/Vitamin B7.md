# Functions
Coenzyme for various carboxylase enzyme complexes, which all add a 1-carbon group
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Fatty acid synthesis: acetyl-CoA carboxylase</span>
	- Acetyl-CoA (2C) → malonyl-CoA (3C)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[Gluconeogenesis|Gluconeogenesis]]: pyruvate carboxylase</span>
	- Pyruvate (3C) → oxaloacetate (4C)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Fatty acid reduction: propionyl-CoA carboxylase</span>
	- Propionyl-CoA (3C) → methylmalonyl-CoA (4C)

>[!tip] 
>Biotin is a coenzyme in all carboxylase enzyme complexes that are not [[vitamin K|vitamin K]]-dependent.

# Epidemiology

# Etiology
- Malnutrition
- Prolonged use of antibiotics (destruction of intestinal flora)
- Excessive consumption of raw egg white: contains avidin → binds biotin in the intestinal lumen → inhibition of biotin resorption
	- Like most proteins, avidin is heat-sensitive and loses this characteristic when cooked.
