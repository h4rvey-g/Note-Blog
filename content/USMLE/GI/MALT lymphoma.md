<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">A B-cell [[Non-Hodgkin lymphomas|non-Hodgkin lymphoma]] (NHL) that typically affects elderly patients in the 7th and 8th decades.</span>
# Epidemiology
---
- Peak incidence: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">7th and 8th decades
</span>
# Etiology
---
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Gastric MALTomas: multiple studies show an association with H. pylori infection. </span>
	- The prevalence of H. pylori infection in low-grade gastric MALTomas is up to 90%.
- Nongastric MALTomas: frequent association with autoimmune conditions
	- Salivary gland MALTomas: see [[Sjogren syndrome|Sjogren syndrome]]

# Pathophysiology
---
The most common trigger for gastric MALT lymphoma is Helicobacter pylori infection, which <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">leads to local recruitment and proliferation of antigen-specific T and B lymphocytes.</span>  Over time, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">chronic immune stimulation results in the emergence of a monoclonal B-cell line that proliferates excessively in the presence of H pylori antigens.</span>  This cell line <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">eventually accumulates genetic abnormalities that allow it to proliferate in an antigen-independent fashion</span>, resulting in spread away from the local site of infection.

# Clinical features
---
- Gastric MALTomas
	- Present similarly to [[peptic ulcer disease|peptic ulcer disease]] and gastritis
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Abdominal pain</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Melena, hematemesis</span>, potentially [[anemia|anemia]]
	- Fatigue, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">weight loss</span>
- Non-gastric MALTomas
	- Salivary MALToma: parotid enlargement
