# Epidemiology
- Adenocarcinoma: most common type of esophageal cancer in the US (67%)
- Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC): most common type of esophageal cancer worldwide (90%)

# Etiology
## Adenocarcinoma
- Exogenous risk factors
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Smoking (twofold risk)</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Obesity</span>
- Endogenous risk factors
	- Male sex
	- Older age (50â€“60 years)
	- Gastroesophageal reflux
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Barrett esophagus</span>
- Localization: mostly in the lower third of the esophagus

>The most important risk factors for esophageal adenocarcinoma are <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">gastroesophageal reflux and associated Barrett esophagus.</span>

## Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)
- Exogenous risk factors
	- Alcohol consumption
	- Smoking (ninefold risk)
	- Diet low in fruits and vegetables
	- Hot beverages
	- Nitrosamines exposure (e.g., cured meat, fish, bacon)
- Endogenous risk factors
	- [[Plummer-Vinson syndrome|Plummer-Vinson syndrome]]
	- Achalasia
 - Localization: mostly in the upper two-thirds of the esophagus
