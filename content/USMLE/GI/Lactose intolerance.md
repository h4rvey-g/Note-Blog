# Pathophysiology
- Lactase is a brush‑border enzyme that cleaves lactose, a disaccharide, into absorbable monosaccharides ([[Galactose metabolism|galactose]] and glucose).
- In the case of lactase deficiency, an almost complete absence of lactose digestion is observed, resulting in decreased absorption in the small intestine (particularly the jejunum).
	- The transfer of osmotically active amounts of lactose into the large intestine leads to the osmotic binding of water → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">diarrhea with a high osmotic gap</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↓ Stool pH (&lt; 6): due to lactose fermentation by colonic bacterial flora</span>
	- Increased peristalsis due to increased intestinal filling → abdominal pain
	- Metabolism of lactose via the physiological bacterial flora of the colon
		- Formation of short‑chain fatty acids that exacerbate diarrhea
		- Increased gas formation and flatulence

# Diagnostics
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hydrogen breath test</span>
	- The amount of hydrogen in the expired air increases after administering lactose in the fasting state. 
	- Procedure
		- Fasting for 8–12 hours
		- Ingestion of lactose 
		- Measurement of breath hydrogen levels at baseline and at 30‑minute intervals over 3 hours
		- Breath hydrogen levels > 20 ppm are considered diagnostic of lactose intolerance.
- Stool analysis
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↑ [[Stool osmotic gap|Stool osmotic gap]] </span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↓ Stool pH (&lt; 6): due to lactose fermentation by colonic bacterial flora</span>

# Treatment
- Avoid or reduce intake of milk products: lactose‑free or lactose‑reduced products
- Oral lactase supplements
