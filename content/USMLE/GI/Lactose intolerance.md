# Epidemiology

# Etiology
- Primary lactase deficiency (lactase nonpersistence)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Most common cause of lactose intolerance</span>
	- Genetic polymorphism in the lactase‑coding gene with subsequent downregulation (absence of lactase-persistence allele)
	- Symptoms occur after lactase activity starts to decrease during childhood; the rate of decline is influenced by genetic factors. 
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Secondary lactase deficiency (acquired)</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Lactase is located distally in the intestinal villi, which are particularly affected by mucosal damage.</span>
	- Due to underlying disorders of the small intestine that result in mucosal damage, e.g.: 
		- Autoimmune disorders (e.g., [[Celiac disease|gluten-sensitive enteropathy]])
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[Infectious gastroenteritis|Infectious gastroenteritis]] (e.g., due to rotavirus, giardiasis)</span>

# Pathophysiology
- Lactase is a brush‑border enzyme that cleaves lactose, a disaccharide, into absorbable monosaccharides ([[Galactose metabolism|galactose]] and glucose).
- In the case of lactase deficiency, an almost complete absence of lactose digestion is observed, resulting in decreased [[absorption|absorption]] in the small intestine (particularly the jejunum).
	- The transfer of osmotically active amounts of lactose into the large intestine leads to the osmotic binding of water → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[diarrhea|diarrhea]] with a high osmotic gap</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↓ Stool pH (&lt; 6): due to lactose fermentation by colonic bacterial flora</span>
	- Increased peristalsis due to increased intestinal filling → abdominal pain
	- Metabolism of lactose via the physiological bacterial flora of the colon
		- Formation of short‑chain fatty acids that exacerbate [[diarrhea|diarrhea]]
		- Increased gas formation and flatulence

# Diagnostics
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hydrogen breath test</span>
	- The amount of hydrogen in the expired air increases after administering lactose in the [[Metabolic fuel use|fasting]] state. 
	- Procedure
		- [[Metabolic fuel use|Fasting]] for 8–12 hours
		- Ingestion of lactose 
		- Measurement of breath hydrogen levels at baseline and at 30‑minute intervals over 3 hours
		- Breath hydrogen levels > 20 ppm are considered diagnostic of lactose intolerance.
- Stool analysis
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↑ [[Stool osmotic gap|Stool osmotic gap]] </span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↓ Stool pH (&lt; 6): due to lactose fermentation by colonic bacterial flora</span>

# Treatment
- Avoid or reduce intake of milk products: lactose‑free or lactose‑reduced products
- Oral lactase supplements
