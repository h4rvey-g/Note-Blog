# Etiology

- Location: 90% of all anal fissures located at the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">posterior commissure (6 o'clock in the lithotomy position)</span>
	- Due to the relatively poor perfusion of the posterior anal canal, which makes its mucosa sensitive to trauma and slows healing times
