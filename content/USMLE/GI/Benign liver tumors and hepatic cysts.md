# Epidemiology
---
Frequency: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">hepatic hemangioma (most common)</span> > focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) > hepatocellular adenoma (rare)

# Etiology
---
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hepatic hemangioma: possible hormonal component; [[Androgen and estrogen synthesis|estrogen]] therapy associated with increased growth</span>
- FNH
	- Mostly unknown
	- Suggested to be the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">result of a localized hyperplastic reaction by hepatocytes to an underlying arteriovenous malformations</span>
- Hepatocellular adenoma: oral [[Contraception|contraceptives]] and anabolic steroids
# Diagnostics
---
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Ultrasonography: best initial test</span>
- Biopsy
	- Performed to confirm the diagnosis if imaging is inconclusive
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Contraindicated in hepatic hemangiomas, as it may cause bleeding</span>
	- Pathology
		- Hepatic hemangioma
			- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Cavernous vascular spaces</span> of variable size, lined by flat endothelial cells![[Screen Shot 2020-02-06 at 4.15.11 PM.jpg|Screen Shot 2020-02-06 at 4.15.11 PM.jpg]]
