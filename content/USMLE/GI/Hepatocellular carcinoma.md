## Metastatic liver disease
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Most common malignant liver lesion</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Typical primary tumor sites: gastrointestinal tract (colon, stomach, pancreas)</span>, lung, and breast
- The most common cause of liver metastases is <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[colorectal cancer|colorectal cancer]]</span>, which spreads directly from the colon or superior rectum <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">through the portal venous system to the liver.</span>
## Hepatic angiosarcoma
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Etiology: associated with exposure to vinyl chloride, [[Arsenic toxicity|arsenic]], or thorium dioxide</span>
- Clinical features
	- Nonspecific (abdominal pain, weight loss, jaundice, ascites, anemia)
	- Can manifest acutely with hypotension and abdominal pain (indicating hemorrhage)
- Diagnostics
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Histology: endothelial cells positive for PECAM-1 (CD31)</span>![[L77807.png|L77807.png]]
- Prognosis
	- Poor (âˆ¼ 6 months)
	- Often metastatic at time of diagnosis, high recurrence rate
