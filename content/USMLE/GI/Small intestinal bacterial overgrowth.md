SIBO is a pathologically excessive growth of bacteria in the small intestine.

# Etiology
---
- Structural abnormalities 
	- Postsurgical complications, e.g.:
		- [[Malabsorption|Short bowel syndrome]]
		- Blind loop syndrome: bacterial overgrowth in the bypassed intestinal segment (blind loop), e.g., due to gastrectomy
		- Adhesions
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Motility disorders </span> 
	- [[Irritable bowel syndrome|Irritable bowel syndrome]] ([[Irritable bowel syndrome|IBS]])
	- Paralytic ileus, e.g., due to opiate use
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Systemic disorders, e.g., diabetic autonomic neuropathy, [[systemic sclerosis|systemic sclerosis]], [[amyloidosis|amyloidosis]]</span>
- Biochemical abnormalities 
	- Achlorhydria, e.g., due to [[atrophic gastritis|atrophic gastritis]]
	- [[Chronic pancreatitis|Chronic pancreatitis]]
- Immune disorders 
	- Common variable [[Congenital immunodeficiency disorders|immunodeficiency]]
	- [[Selective IgA deficiency|Selective IgA deficiency]]
	- [[Human immunodeficiency virus|HIV]]

# Pathophysiology
---
- The following result from bacterial overgrowth. 
	- ↑ Deconjugation of the bile acids
	- ↑ Production of folate
	- ↓ absorption of [[vitamin B12|vitamin B12]], fat-soluble vitamins, zinc, and iron

# Clinical features
---
- Bloating, flatulence
- Chronic watery diarrhea
- Severe: [[steatorrhea|steatorrhea]], vitamin deficiencies
