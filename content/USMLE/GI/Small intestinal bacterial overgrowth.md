# Etiology
---
- Structural abnormalities 
	- Postsurgical complications, e.g.:
		- [[Malabsorption|Short bowel syndrome]]
		- Blind loop syndrome: bacterial overgrowth in the bypassed intestinal segment (blind loop), e.g., due to gastrectomy
		- Adhesions
- Motility disorders  
	- [[Irritable bowel syndrome|Irritable bowel syndrome]] ([[Irritable bowel syndrome|IBS]])
	- Paralytic ileus, e.g., due to opiate use

# Pathophysiology
---
- The following result from bacterial overgrowth. 
	- ↑ Deconjugation of the bile acids
	- ↑ Production of folate
	- ↓ absorption of [[vitamin B12|vitamin B12]], fat-soluble vitamins, zinc, and iron
