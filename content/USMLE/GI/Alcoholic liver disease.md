Hepatic degradation of ethanol to acetyl-CoA by alcohol dehydrogenase results in <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">NADH excess</span> (see [[Alcohol Metabolism|Alcohol Metabolism]]) → ↑ NADH drives the formation of <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">glycerol 3-phosphate (G3P) from dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP)</span> → ↑ in both G3P and fatty acids causes <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">increased triglyceride synthesis in the liver and accompanying inflammation</span> → steatohepatitis → chronic inflammation leads to hepatic fibrosis and sclerosis → portal hypertension and eventually [[cirrhosis|cirrhosis]]![[Pasted image 20240224213058.png|Pasted image 20240224213058.png]]
