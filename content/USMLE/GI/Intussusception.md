# Etiology
---
- Mostly idiopathic
	- âˆ¼ 75% of cases have no identifiable lead point
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Lead point: An intraperitoneal anomaly or abnormality that obstructs or tethers the bowel, provoking intussusception.</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">More common in children 3 months to 5 years of age</span>
- Pathological lead points
	- Defined as intraperitoneal anomalies or abnormalities that obstruct or tether the bowel and act as lead points in the process of intussusception 
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[Meckel diverticulum|Meckel diverticulum]] (most common in children)</span>
		- Intestinal polyps or other benign tumors (most common in adults and 2nd most common in general)
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Enlarged Peyer patches: individuals with a history of a recent viral infection or immunization (e.g., rotavirus or adenovirus) </span>
			- Viral stimulation of lymphoid follicles within the small intestine (Peyer patches) can lead to <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">hypertrophy of those areas, which can then act as lead points that become trapped</span> by peristalsis and dragged into a distal portion of the intestine.  
			- The most common location is at the ileocecal junction, as in this patient, and is likely due to a dense concentration of Peyer patches in the terminal ileum.
