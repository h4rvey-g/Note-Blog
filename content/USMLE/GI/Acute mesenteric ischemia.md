Acute reduction in arterial or venous blood flow to the small intestine; may result in bowel ischemia or infarct
# Epidemiology
---


# Etiology
---
- Acute mesenteric artery embolism
	- Most common cause of AMI (causes 50% of all cases)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Risk factors include [[atrial fibrillation|atrial fibrillation]], myocardial infarction</span>
	- Most commonly involves the SMA
- Acute mesenteric artery thrombosis
	- Causes ∼ 25% of cases
	- Risk factors include visceral [[atherosclerosis|atherosclerosis]]
- Nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia
	- Causes ∼ 20% of cases
	- Most commonly occurs in critically ill patients with low cardiac output
- Mesenteric venous thrombosis
	- Least common cause of AMI (causes < 10% of all cases)
	- Risk factors include infection, malignancy, portal hypertension, [[Androgen and estrogen synthesis|estrogen]] therapy, and hypercoagulability disorders.

# Pathophysiology
---
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Sudden interruption of blood flow to small bowel → intestinal hypoxia → hemorrhagic infarction and necrosis</span> → disruption of the mucosal barrier and perforation → release of bacteria, toxins, and vasoactive substances → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">life-threatening sepsis</span>
- Sites of vessel occlusion
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">SMA</span> (∼ 90% of cases) 


# Clinical features
---
## AMI
- Severe periumbilical pain out of proportion to physical examination
- Diarrhea (bloody in later stages)
>[!tip] 
>- Patients with <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">acute mesenteric artery embolism typically present with the classic triad of severe abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, and [[atrial fibrillation|atrial fibrillation]].</span>
>- Patients with <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">acute mesenteric artery thrombosis typically have known cardiovascular or [[Peripheral arterial disease|peripheral vascular disease]] and/or symptoms of CMI in addition to acute symptoms.</span>
## CMI 
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Postprandial abdominal pain: begins 10–30 minutes after eating and lasts 1–2 hours</span>
- Food aversion (sitophobia): <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">fear of eating</span> because of postprandial pain
- Unintended weight loss
