# Thyroglossal duct cyst
- Painless, firm, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">midline</span> neck mass that elevates with swallowing and tongue protrusion
- Usually located near the hyoid bone 
- May cause dysphagia or neck/throat pain
# Branchial cleft cyst
- **Definition:** <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">remnants of the embryological second branchial cleft or cervical sinus</span>, which normally regresses before birth
- **Pathophysiology:** formed due to incomplete obliteration of branchial clefts and pouches![[Pasted image 20231015111236.png|Pasted image 20231015111236.png]]
- **Clinical features:** usually diagnosed in late childhood or in adulthood after a previously undiagnosed cyst becomes infected 
	- History of upper respiratory infection
	- Painless, firm mass
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Located lateral to the midline, usually anterior to the sternocleidomastoid muscle</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Does not move with swallowing</span>
	- There may be a small draining opening if a fistula is present.
- Ultrasound: Round mass with uniform low echogenicity and no internal septations
>[!tip] 
>Branchial cleft cysts manifest as a painless, firm neck mass lateral to the midline.
# Cystic hygroma
- Definition: a congenital lymphatic cyst (macrocystic lymphangioma) in the posterior triangle of the neck caused by malformation and obstruction of the fetal lymphatic system
- Epidemiology
	- âˆ¼ 1:6,000 live births 
	- Strongly associated with fetal aneuploidy (e.g., Turner syndrome, trisomy 21) and congenital malformations (e.g., congenital heart defects)
- Clinical features
	- Present at birth as a soft, compressible, painless, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">posterior triangle</span> neck mass ![[Pasted image 20231015143315.png|Pasted image 20231015143315.png]]
	- Can cause dysphagia or airway compromise
	- Positive transillumination test
