# Etiology
## Cholesterol stones
- Risk factors
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Obesity</span>, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Female sex</span>
		- Especially during reproductive years due to <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">increased levels of estrogen and progesterone</span>
		- Increased estrogen levels cause increased secretion of bile rich in cholesterol, (lithogenic bile), which can result in the formation of cholesterol gallstones.
		- Increased progesterone levels cause smooth muscle relaxation, decreased gallbladder contraction, and subsequent bile stasis with formation of gallstones.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Multiparity or pregnancy</span>
	- Age (> 40 years of age)
	- European, Native American, or Hispanic ancestry
	- Family history
	- Drugs: fibrates (inhibition of cholesterol 7-α hydroxylase), estrogen therapy, oral contraceptives
	- Malabsorption (e.g., Crohn disease, ileal resection, cystic fibrosis) 
	- Rapid weight loss (e.g., after bariatric surgery)

# Treatment
## Nonoperative management of cholelithiasis
### Indications
- Patients at high risk of complications due to surgery or anesthesia (e.g., recent myocardial infarction)
- Patients unwilling to undergo surgery
### Oral bile acid dissolution therapy 
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">May be useful in dissolving pure cholesterol stones (i.e., radiolucent stones) that are &lt 0.5 cm </span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Ursodeoxycholic acid</span>
- Duration of therapy: 6–24 months [17][33]
### Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL)
