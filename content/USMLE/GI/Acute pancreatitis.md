# Epidemiology


---
# Etiology
## Most common causes
- Biliary pancreatitis (∼ 40% of cases; mostly caused by <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[gallstones|gallstones]]</span>) 
	- Blockage of the common bile duct and pancreatic duct
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Alcohol-induced</span> (∼ 20% of cases)
- Idiopathic (∼ 25% of cases)
## Other causes
 - Recent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) procedure
 - Drugs (eg, azathioprine, sulfasalazine, furosemide, valproic acid)
 - Infections (eg, [[mumps|mumps]], Coxsackie virus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae)
 - <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hypertriglyceridemia</span>: caused by severe hypertriglyceridemia (> 1,000 mg/dL)
	 - Pathogenesis involves toxic fatty acids that are released from triglycerides via breakdown by pancreatic lipase. Associated with primary (e.g., type V hyperlipidemia) as well as secondary (e.g., due to medications) forms of hypertriglyceridemia.
 - Structural abnormalities of the pancreatic duct (strictures, cancer, pancreas divisum) or of the ampullary region (choledochal cyst, stenosis of sphincter of Oddi)
 - Surgery (particularly of the stomach and biliary tract and after cardiac surgery)
 - [[Hypercalcemia|Hypercalcemia]]

# Pathophysiology

# Clinical features
## Symptoms
- Constant, severe epigastric pain
	- Classically radiating towards the back![[1821dda8c134787c9bffce71f1c1426.jpg|1821dda8c134787c9bffce71f1c1426.jpg]]
	- Worse after meals and when supine
	- Improves on leaning forwards
- Nausea, vomiting
- Fever
## Examination findings
- General
	- Signs of shock: tachycardia, hypotension, oliguria/anuria
		- Due to distributive shock from cytokine release, and third-spacing of intravascular fluid.
	- Abdominal examination
- Abdominal tenderness, distention, guarding 
	- Ileus with reduced bowel sounds and tympany on percussion
	- Ascites
	- Skin changes (rare) 
		- Cullen sign: periumbilical ecchymosis and discoloration (bluish-red) ![[Pasted image 20231004171430.png|Pasted image 20231004171430.png]]
		- Grey Turner sign: flank ecchymosis with discoloration ![[Pasted image 20231004171443.png|Pasted image 20231004171443.png]]
		- Fox sign: ecchymosis over the inguinal ligament

>[!tip] 
>Circulating pancreatic enzymes cause swelling of the subcutaneous tissue and localized hemorrhages. These signs, though nonspecific, suggest retroperitoneal bleeding and are associated with a poor prognosis.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Pulmonary examination: signs of [[pleural effusion|pleural effusion]] and/or [[Acute respiratory distress syndrome|ARDS]] may be present</span>
	- Pancreatitis is a major risk factor for [[Acute respiratory distress syndrome|ARDS]] as it results in the release of large amounts of inflammatory cytokines and pancreatic enzymes into the circulation, which leads to infiltration of neutrophils into the pulmonary interstitium and alveolar spaces.

>[!tip] 
>As the pancreas is a retroperitoneal organ, abdominal guarding may not be present with the typical hard rigidity seen in inflammation of intraperitoneal organs. Instead, the abdomen is distended and elastic on palpation.

# Diagnostics
## Diagnostic criteria for acute pancreatitis
Two of the three following criteria should be met for a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis to be made. 
- Characteristic abdominal pain
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↑ Serum pancreatic enzymes: lipase or amylase ≥ 3× ULN</span>
- Characteristic findings of acute pancreatitis on cross-sectional imaging (e.g., contrast-enhanced CT abdomen)
