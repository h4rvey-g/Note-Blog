# Epidemiology
- Peak incidence: older male individuals (70-80 y)
- Zenker diverticulum is the most common type.

---
# Etiology


---
# Pathophysiology
- Inadequate relaxation of the esophageal sphincter (e.g., caused by achalasia or spastic motility) and increased intraluminal pressure → outpouching of the esophageal wall → pulsion diverticulum
	- Usually a false diverticulum
	- Common sites
		- Upper esophageal sphincter (UES) → pharyngoesophageal pulsion diverticulum (e.g., <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Zenker diverticulum</span>)
		- Lower esophageal sphincter (LES) → epiphrenic pulsion diverticulum
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Inflammation of the mediastinum with scarring and retraction</span> (e.g., secondary to tuberculosis or fungal infection) → traction diverticulum 
	- Usually true diverticulum
	- Common site: the middle esophagus

# Clinical features
- Upper esophageal [[Diverticulosis|diverticula]] (e.g., Zenker diverticulum)
- Most patients report some degree of dysphagia.
- Additional symptoms can include:
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Regurgitation of undigested food</span>
	- Halitosis 
		- Originating from food or medicine retained within the diverticulum
	- Aspiration pneumonia
	- Dysphonia
	- Coughing after ingesting food
	- Retrosternal pressure sensation and pain
	- Weight loss 
	- Neck mass (only with large upper esophageal diverticula)
