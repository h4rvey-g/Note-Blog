- Esophageal motility disorders include disorders of hypomotility (e.g., [[achalasia|achalasia]]) and hypermotility (e.g., diffuse esophageal spasm).
- Distal esophageal spasm (DES; corkscrew esophagus): premature and uncoordinated nonpropagative esophageal peristalsis in at least 20% of swallows

# Clinical features

- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Intermittent dysphagia to liquids (and potentially, solids)</span>
	- Dysphagia predominantly to solids is more suggestive of a mechanical obstruction, e.g., a esophageal stricture, cancer, or ring.

# Diagnostics

## Manometry
- Procedure: measures the amplitude, length, and duration of the peristaltic waves via a nasogastric tube fitted with numerous pressure sensors 
- Findings![[L27471.jpg|L27471.jpg]]
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Normal condition:</span> To initiate swallowing, the contents of the oral cavity are collected on the tongue and propelled into the pharynx, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">where contraction of the pharyngeal muscles pushes the material into the esophagus</span>.  The cricopharyngeus muscle contracts behind the food bolus, initiating a peristaltic wave to propel the bolus downward.  When the food bolus reaches the lower esophagus, the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">lower esophageal sphincter (LES) relaxes to allow the material to enter the stomach.</span>
	- [[Systemic sclerosis|Systemic sclerosis]] ([[Systemic sclerosis|scleroderma]]) can affect the esophagus, leading to <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">impaired motility, incompetence of the LES, and [[gastroesophageal reflux disease|gastroesophageal reflux disease]].  Manometry will show decreased peristalsis with decreased tone at the LES.</span>
	- [[Achalasia|Achalasia]]: 
		- A motility disorder caused by reduced numbers of inhibitory ganglion cells in the esophageal wall, which creates an imbalance favoring excitatory ganglion cells.  
		- This patient's esophageal manometry shows typical findings in [[achalasia|achalasia]], including <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">normal contraction of the upper esophageal sphincter, decreased amplitude of peristalsis in the mid esophagus, and increased tone and incomplete relaxation at the LES</span>
	- Diffuse esophageal spasm presents with severe, retrosternal chest pain. It is characterized by <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">uncoordinated contractions of the esophageal body</span>.  Esophageal manometry shows <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">intermittent peristalsis and multiple simultaneous contractions on tracings from the mid and lower esophagus.</span>
	- Esophageal stricture presents with progressive solid food dysphagia.  <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">It is diagnosed with contrast imaging (eg, barium swallow) rather than manometry.</span>  However, most patients will have a long history of gastroesophageal reflux with decreased tone at the LES.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Distal esophageal spasm: premature contractions in at least 20% of swallows </span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Disorganized non-peristaltic contractions on esophageal manometry and "corkscrew" esophagus on barium esophagogram</span>
	- Hypercontractile esophagus: hypertensive esophageal contractions in at least 20% of swallows 
	- HRM may be normal between acute episodes
# Differential diagnostics
---
Esophageal motility disorders typically cause dysphagia with both solids and liquids. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Dysphagia predominantly with solids is suggestive of a mechanical obstruction</span> (intraluminal, mural, or extrinsic).
- [[Esophageal cancer|Esophageal cancer]] (older age)
- [[Eosinophilic esophagitis|Eosinophilic esophagitis]] (younger age)
- Esophageal webs or rings 
- Esophageal diverticulum
- Extrinsic esophageal compression (e.g., hilar lymphadenopathy)
