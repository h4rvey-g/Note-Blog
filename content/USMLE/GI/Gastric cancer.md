# Epidemiology

# Etiology

## Exogenous risk factors
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Diet rich in [[nitrates|nitrates]] and/or salts (e.g., dried foods, foods preserved by curing or smoking) and low in fresh vegetables containing antioxidants</span>
	- Bacteria are believed to convert ingested [[nitrates|nitrates]] into carcinogenic nitrites.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">H. pylori infection</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Nicotine use</span> 
- Epstein-Barr virus 
## Endogenous risk factors
- Gastric conditions
	- Chronic [[atrophic gastritis|atrophic gastritis]] and associated pernicious anemia
	- Achlorhydria (e.g., due to [[Ménétrier disease|Ménétrier disease]])
	- Gastric ulcers

## Gastric adenocarcinoma
- Accounts for ∼ 95% of cases 
- Most commonly located on the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">lesser curvature</span>
### Lauren classification of gastric adenocarcinoma
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Intestinal type</span> gastric carcinoma 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Typically localized </span>
	- Polypoid, glandular formation![[L76015.png|L76015.png]]
	- Similar to an ulcerative lesion with clear raised margins
	- Commonly located on the lesser curvature
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Must be differentiated from peptic gastric ulcers by biopsy</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Diffuse type</span> gastric carcinoma 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">No clear border </span>
	- Spreads earlier in the course of disease
	- Infiltrative growth
	- Diffuse spread in the gastric wall 
	- Linitis plastica: gastric wall thickening and leather bottle appearance
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Composed of signet ring cells: round cells filled with mucin, with a flat nucleus in the cell periphery </span>![[highresdefault_L66770.jpg|highresdefault_L66770.jpg]]
	- Associated with E-cadherin mutation
		- E-cadherin is a family of calcium-dependent glycoproteins that facilitate cell-to-cell adhesion at adherens junctions. Link to the actin [[cytoskeleton|cytoskeleton]] via catenin and vinculin.
		- Due to its role in cell adhesion and differentiation, E-cadherin protects against tumor formation. Low expression is associated with poorer prognosis (e.g., increased depth of invasion or severe lymph node involvement).

# Complications

## Postgastrectomy complications
### Dumping syndrome
- Definition: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">rapid gastric emptying</span> as a result of defective gastric reservoir function, impaired pyloric emptying mechanisms, or anomalous postsurgery gastric motor function
#### Early dumping
- Pathophysiology: dysfunctional or bypassed pyloric sphincter → rapid emptying of undiluted <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">hyperosmolar chyme into the small intestine → fluid shift to the intestinal lumen → small bowel distention → vagal stimulation → increased intestinal motility</span>
- Clinical features
	- Occur within <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">15–30 minutes after meal ingestion</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Include nausea, vomiting, [[diarrhea|diarrhea]], and cramps</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Vasomotor symptoms such as sweating, flushing, and palpitations</span>
- Management
	- Dietary modifications: small meals that include a combination of complex carbohydrates and foods rich in protein and fat
#### Late dumping
- Pathophysiology: dysfunctional pyloric sphincter → rapid emptying of <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">glucose-containing chyme into the small intestine → quick reabsorption of glucose → hyperglycemia → excessive release of insulin → [[hypoglycemia|hypoglycemia]] and release of catecholamines</span>
- Clinical features
	- Occur <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">hours after meal ingestion</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Include signs of [[hypoglycemia|hypoglycemia]] (e.g., hunger, [[tremor|tremor]], lightheadedness)</span>
	- GI discomfort
- Management
	- Dietary modifications
	- Second-line treatment: octreotide
	- Third-line treatment: surgery
