- [[Gallstones|Gallstone]] ileus: mechanical bowel obstruction due to obstructive [[gallstones|gallstones]]
	- Pathophysiology: gallbladder perforation or [[Mirizzi syndrome|Mirizzi syndrome]] → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">biliary-enteric fistula formation</span> (most commonly cholecystoenteric fistula) between the inflamed gallbladder and bowel → [[gallstones|gallstones]] passing down into bowel lumen![[Pasted image 20231210113528.png|Pasted image 20231210113528.png]]
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Sites of obstruction: terminal ileum, at ileocecal valve (most common)</span>
	- Symptoms: distal bowel obstruction: features of mechanical bowel obstruction (abdominal pain and distention, nausea, vomiting)
	- Diagnosis is based on the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Rigler triad: imaging findings of small bowel obstruction, [[Gallstones|gallstone]] (most commonly in iliac fossa), and pneumobilia</span>.
		- Air can move up toward the biliary ducts through a cholecystoenteric fistula.![[Pasted image 20231210113752.png|Pasted image 20231210113752.png]]![[Pasted image 20231210113759.png|Pasted image 20231210113759.png]]
