- Cytokine‑mediated activation of hepatic <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">stellate cells</span> has been identified as a central element for developing fibrosis.![[Pasted image 20231207091221.png|Pasted image 20231207091221.png]]
	- A cell found in the perisinusoidal space of the liver

# Complications

## Portal hypertension
- Portal vein collateral circulation 
	- Portal vein → Left gastric vein → Esophageal venous plexus → Azygos vein → Superior vena cava
	- Portal vein → Inferior mesenteric vein → Rectal venous plexus → Internal iliac vein → Inferior vena cava
	- Portal vein → Paraumbilical vein → Periumbilical venous network → Abdominal wall vein → Superior and inferior vena cava
