# Etiology
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Cardiac cirrhosis</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">A complication of right-sided heart failure characterized by cirrhosis due to chronic hepatic vein congestion.</span>
	- Associated with "<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">nutmeg liver</span>" (diffuse mottling on imaging due to ischemia and fatty degeneration).![[Pasted image 20241217102311.png|Pasted image 20241217102311.png]]![[L46840.jpg|L46840.jpg]]

# Pathophysiology
- Cytokine‑mediated activation of hepatic <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">stellate cells</span> has been identified as a central element for developing fibrosis.![[Pasted image 20231207091221.png|Pasted image 20231207091221.png]]
	- A cell found in the perisinusoidal space of the liver
		- Quiescent phase: [[vitamin A|vitamin A]] storage
		- Activated phase: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">transform into myofibroblast to secrete [[collagen|collagen]] (primary cell involved in hepatic fibrosis)</span>

# Diagnostics
## CT abdomen
- Relative hypertrophy of the left lobe and caudate lobe
- Regenerative nodules
- Irregular liver surface 
- Indirect findings: ascites, [[splenomegaly|splenomegaly]], portosystemic collaterals

## Pathology
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Fibrosis (fibrous septa)</span>![[L26649.png|L26649.png]]
- Replacement of normal liver tissue with collagenous regenerative nodules

# Complications

## Portal hypertension
- Portal vein collateral circulation 
	- Portal vein → Left gastric vein → Esophageal venous plexus → Azygos vein → Superior vena cava
	- Portal vein → Inferior mesenteric vein → Rectal venous plexus → Internal iliac vein → Inferior vena cava
	- Portal vein → Paraumbilical vein → Periumbilical venous network → Abdominal wall vein → Superior and inferior vena cava
