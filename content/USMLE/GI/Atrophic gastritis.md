# Etiology
---
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Autoimmune metaplastic atrophic gastritis (AMAG)</span>
	- Associated with major histocompatibility haplotypes HLA-B8 and [[HLA system|HLA-DR3]]
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Environmental metaplastic atrophic gastritis (EMAG)</span>
	- Helicobacter pylori infection
		- Most important risk factor for chronic gastritis, including atrophic gastritis 
		- Colonizes mainly antrum of stomach

# Pathophysiology
---
## AMAG
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Autoimmune destruction of the parietal cells</span> in the gastric corpus and fundus (T-cell induced autoantibodies against H<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase)  → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">achlorhydria → increased release of gastrin (due to loss of negative feedback)  → G cell [[Cellular adaptations|hyperplasia]] → hypergastrinemia → hyperplasia of enterochromaffin-like cells → ↑ risk of [[Carcinoid tumor|carcinoid tumors]].</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Achlorhydria impairs the intestinal absorption of inorganic iron → iron deficiency anemia</span> (early manifestation)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Autoantibodies against [[intrinsic factor|intrinsic factor]] → [[Vitamin B12|vitamin B12 deficiency]] → pernicious anemia</span>
## EMAG
- Colonization by H. pylori
	- Inflammation of the antrum → destruction of D cells → ↓ somatostatin → ↑ gastrin → ↑ production of gastric acids → duodenal ulcers 
	- Inflammation of the gastric body → local destruction of mucosa (via cytotoxins such as ammonia) → ↓ production of mucins and atrophy of the gastric glands → hypochlorhydria → hypergastrinemia and epithelial dysplasia → epithelial [[Cellular adaptations|metaplasia]] → ↑ risk of gastric cancers
