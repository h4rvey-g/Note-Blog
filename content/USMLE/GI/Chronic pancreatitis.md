# Epidemiology


---
# Etiology
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Chronic heavy alcohol use (most common, esp. men)</span>
- Pancreatic ductal obstruction
- Tobacco use
- Idiopathic pancreatitis
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hereditary pancreatitis</span>
	- PRSS1 gene mutation
	- Age of onset < 20 years
	- Characterized by a positive family history and the absence of other risk factors
- Systemic disease
	- [[Cystic fibrosis|Cystic fibrosis]]
	- Severe hypertriglyceridemia (levels > 1,000 mg/dL)

# Clinical features
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Epigastric abdominal pain (main symptom) </span>
	- Pain radiates to the back, is relieved on bending forward, and <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">is exacerbated after eating.</span>
	- Often associated with nausea and vomiting
- Features of pancreatic insufficiency: late manifestation (after 90% of the pancreatic parenchyma is destroyed) 
	- [[Steatorrhea|Steatorrhea]] (exocrine enzyme deficiency)
		- Cramping abdominal pain, bloating, [[diarrhea|diarrhea]]
		- Can lead to a deficiency of fat-soluble [[Water-soluble vitamins|vitamins]] (A, D, E, and K)
	- [[Malabsorption|Malabsorption]] and weight loss 
	- Pancreatic [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]] (endocrine hormone deficiency) 
# Complications
## Pancreatic pseudocysts
### Definition
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Encapsulated collection of pancreatic fluid that develops 4 weeks after an acute attack of pancreatitis</span> (can occur in both acute and chronic pancreatitis)
### Pathophysiology
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Pancreatic secretions leak from damaged ducts → inflammatory reaction of surrounding tissue → encapsulation of secretions by granulation tissue</span>
### Clinical features
- Often asymptomatic
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Painless abdominal mass</span>
- Pressure effects
	- Gastric outlet obstruction (early satiety, nonbilious vomiting, abdominal pain)
	- Obstruction of the distal duodenum (bilious vomiting) may result in [[steatorrhea|steatorrhea]].
	- Bile duct obstruction with jaundice
### Diagnostics
- First line: CT abdomen with contrast  
	- Findings: Extrapancreatic fluid collection within well-defined wall or capsule with contrast enhancement![[Pasted image 20231127153909.png|Pasted image 20231127153909.png]]![[Pasted image 20231127153916.png|Pasted image 20231127153916.png]]A large circumscribed fluid collection (green overlay) with an enhancing wall (red overlay) surrounds the pancreas (P).

# Diagnostics
- Serum pancreatic enzyme levels: Lipase (specific) and amylase (nonspecific) are often normal.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Fecal elastase-1 (FE-1): most common test</span> 
	- Elastase is derived from a zymogen produced by pancreatic acinar cells and activated by trypsin in the duodenum; levels correlate with pancreatic exocrine activity.  Therefore, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">low fecal elastase can help diagnose pancreatic insufficiency</span> and supports a diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis. 
- Sudan staining (which identifies fecal fat)
