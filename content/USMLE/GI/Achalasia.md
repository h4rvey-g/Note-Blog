# Epidemiology
---


# Etiology
---


# Pathophysiology
---
- Atrophy of inhibitory neurons in the Auerbach plexus → lack of inhibitory neurotransmitters (e.g., NO, VIP) → inability to relax and increased resting pressure of the LES, as well as dysfunctional peristalsis → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">esophageal dilation proximal to LES</span>

# Clinical features
---


# Diagnostics
---
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Esophageal barium swallow</span>: supportive and/or confirmatory test 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Bird-beak sign: dilation of the proximal esophagus with stenosis of the gastroesophageal junction </span>![[L6.png|L6.png]]
	- Delayed barium emptying or barium retention
