# Epidemiology
- 50% acquired during travels abroad

---
# Etiology
- Contaminated water and food (e.g., raw shellfish)

---
# Pathophysiology
- HAV is not cytopathic in itself; research suggests that liver damage is caused by cellular immunity (especially CD8+ T cells).

# Clinical features
>[!tip] 
>Unlike [[hepatitis B|hepatitis B]] or C, HAV infection is a self-limiting disease that is <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">not associated with an asymptomatic viral carrier state and does not progress to chronic hepatitis, [[cirrhosis|cirrhosis]], or [[hepatocellular carcinoma|hepatocellular carcinoma]].</span>

<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">In children age &lt; 6, HAV infection is most often (>80%) silent or subclinical</span> . Clinical disease is typically more severe (70% of symptomatic patients with jaundice) in adults (some of whom develop an aversion to smoking, for unclear reasons)

- Incubation period: 2–6 weeks
- Phases of acute viral hepatitis 
	- Prodromal phase: 1–2 weeks
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Right upper quadrant pain, tender [[hepatomegaly|hepatomegaly]]</span>
		- Fever, malaise
		- Anorexia, nausea, vomiting
	- Icteric phase: ∼ 2 weeks 
		- Jaundice
		- [[Urine color|Dark urine]] and pale stools 
		- Pruritus
	- Resolution of symptoms
