# Epidemiology


---
# Etiology
- Parenteral
	- Needle sharing among individuals who use injection drugs 
	- Needlestick injury (e.g., health care workers)
	- Blood [[transfusion|transfusion]]
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Dialysis</span>
- Organ transplantation
- Sexual: rare (in contrast to [[Hepatitis B|HBV]] and [[Human immunodeficiency virus|HIV]])

# Pathophysiology
## Pathogen
- The risk of chronic infection is multifactorial and depends on the host's ability to clear the pathogen through activation of multiple innate immunity pathways against the viral envelope. 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Flawed proofreading capability of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (no 3′– 5′ exonuclease activity) introduces mutations into genes encoding viral glycoprotein envelope and enabling novel antigen production.</span>
	- Rapid replication rate produces many antigenically unique viral envelopes.
	- Infection persists because the production rate of new mutant virions exceeds the production rate of host antibodies.

# Clinical features
## Incubation period
- 2 weeks to 6 months
## Chronic course
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Seen especially in asymptomatic individuals (up to 85%), as the disease may go undiagnosed and treatment may be delayed or never initiated (carrier state).</span>
- Findings often mild, nonspecific (e.g., fatigue)
- Liver [[cirrhosis|cirrhosis]] (up to 25% of cases) within 20 years of infection
- Extrahepatic features of HCV (common) 
	- Hematological
		- Mixed cryoglobulinemia
		- Lymphoma (especially B-cell [[Non-Hodgkin lymphomas|non-Hodgkin lymphoma]])
		- [[Immune thrombocytopenia|ITP]]
		- [[Autoimmune hemolytic anemia|Autoimmune hemolytic anemia]]
		- Monoclonal gammopathies
	- Renal
		- [[Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis|Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis]] (more common)
		- Membranous glomerulonephritis
	- Dermatological
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Porphyria cutanea tarda</span>
		- [[Oral white lesions|Lichen planus]]
	- Endocrine
		- [[Diabetes mellitus|Diabetes mellitus]]
		- Autoimmune thyroiditis (may lead to [[hypothyroidism|hypothyroidism]])
	- Vascular: leukocytoclastic [[Vasculitides|vasculitis]]

# Treatment
## [[Antiviral therapy|Antiviral therapy]]
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Direct-acting antivirals (DAAs)</span>
	- Antivirals target and inhibit HCV-encoded proteins that are essential for the HCV replication cycle.
	- Example regimens
		- Glecaprevir PLUS pibrentasvir (all 6 genotypes)
		- Sofosbuvir PLUS velpatasvir (all 6 genotypes)
		- Ledipasvir PLUS sofosbuvir (genotypes 1, 4, 5, and 6)
- [[Interferons|Interferon]] PLUS ribavirin
	- Was the preferred treatment before the development of DAAs
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Associated with severe adverse effects</span> (e.g., arthralgias, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, depression, anemia) and teratogenicity
	- Contraindicated in patients with decompensated [[cirrhosis|cirrhosis]] (high risk of worsening [[cirrhosis|cirrhosis]] decompensation)
	- Ribavirin
		- Mechanism of action
			- Guanosine analogue (nucleoside inhibitor)
			- Competitive inhibition of IMP dehydrogenase → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">prevention of guanine nucleosides synthesis</span>
		- Adverse effects
			- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hemolytic anemia</span>
			- Highly [[Teratogenesis|teratogenic]]

>[!tip] 
>DAAs have superior efficacy and safety profiles compared with [[Interferons|interferon]] or ribavirin-based regimens and are thus preferred.
