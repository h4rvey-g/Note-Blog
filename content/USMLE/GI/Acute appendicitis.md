# Epidemiology
- Peak incidence: 10â€“19 years of age

---
# Etiology
- Caused by obstruction of the appendiceal lumen due to:
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Lymphoid tissue hyperplasia (60% of cases): most common cause in children and young adults</span> 
		- The lamina propria and submucosa of the appendix have an abundance of lymphoid follicles. Hyperplasia of these follicles may be physiological (e.g., during childhood and adolescence, when lymphoid tissue is developing and maturing) or pathological (e.g., secondary to an infectious or inflammatory process within the bowel).![[Pasted image 20231207163951.png|Pasted image 20231207163951.png]]
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Appendiceal fecalith (concretion of feces that develops in the appendix that can obstruct the appendiceal lumen) and fecal stasis (35% of cases): most common cause in adults</span>
	- Neoplasm (uncommon): more likely in patients > 50 years of age  
	- Parasitic infestation
