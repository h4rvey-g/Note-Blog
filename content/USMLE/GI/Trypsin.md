- **Pancreatic enzymes** (except amylase and lipase) are synthesized and secreted in an **inactive form** to protect the pancreas from autodigestion. 
	- These proenzymes (zymogens) are activated by **trypsin** in the duodenal lumen.
	- **Trypsinogen** is converted into active trypsin by **duodenal enterokinase**.
- **Activation cascade**:
	- Trypsin can activate other trypsinogen molecules.
	- Even small amounts of trypsin can trigger this cascade.
- **Protective mechanisms** to limit premature trypsinogen activation:
	- **Serine peptidase inhibitor Kazal-type 1 (SPINK1)**:
		- Secreted by pancreatic acinar cells.
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Functions as a trypsin inhibitor, impeding prematurely activated trypsinogen molecules within the pancreas.</span>
	- **Trypsin self-inhibition**:
		- Trypsin can cleave active trypsin molecules at a second site, rendering them inactive.
- **Hereditary pancreatitis**:
	- Rare disorder caused by <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">mutations in the **trypsinogen** or **SPINK1** gene.</span>
	- Common mutation results in <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">abnormal trypsin that is not susceptible to inactivating cleavage by trypsin.</span>
	- Protective mechanisms are critical as small amounts of trypsinogen normally activate prematurely within pancreatic acini and ducts.
	- Failure of these mechanisms leads to recurrent acute pancreatitis.
