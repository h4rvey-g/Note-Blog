# Epidemiology


---
# Etiology


---
# Pathophysiology
- Chronic Th2 cellâ€“mediated disorder triggered by food antigens
- Eosinophilic infiltration of the esophageal mucosa

---
# Clinical features
- Dysphagia, food bolus impaction 
- Symptoms can be worsened by ingestion of food containing allergens.
- Associated features: [[atopy|atopy]] (e.g., [[asthma|asthma]], rhinitis, [[atopic dermatitis|atopic dermatitis]], alimentary allergies)

# Diagnostics
## Endoscopic findings 
- Circumferential mucosal lesions (e.g., rings, corrugations), with possible esophageal trachealization (presence of multiple rings in the esophagus, which results in a furrowed or corrugated appearance similar to the trachea)  
- Longitudinal furrows![[Pasted image 20231015160934.png|Pasted image 20231015160934.png]]
## Histopathologic findings
- Intraepithelial accumulation of eosinophils![[Pasted image 20231015161630.png|Pasted image 20231015161630.png]]![[Pasted image 20231015161639.png|Pasted image 20231015161639.png]]
