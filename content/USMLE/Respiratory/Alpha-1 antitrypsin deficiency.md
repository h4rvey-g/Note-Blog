# Etiology
mutations in SERPINA1 gene
- M is the normal allele.
- S mutation causes a moderate decrease in AAT production.
- Z mutation causes a significant decrease in AAT production.
- The severity of disease depends on the specific genotypic expression, which correlates with the amount of α1-antitrypsin protein synthesis
	- PiMM: 100% expression of normal protein and therefore normal serum levels of AAT
	- PiMS: 80% of normal serum levels of AAT
	- PiSS, PiMZ, PiSZ: 40–60% of normal serum levels of AAT
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">PiZZ: 10–15% of normal serum levels of AAT (severe AAT deficiency)</span>

# Pathophysiology
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Alpha-1 antitrypsin: a protease inhibitor that is synthesized in the liver and protects cells from breakdown by neutrophil elastase</span>
- Gene mutation induces a conformational change in the structure of AAT protein → dysfunctional (or absent) AAT
	- Effect on the liver: accumulation of AAT in hepatocellular [[endoplasmic reticulum|endoplasmic reticulum]] → hepatocyte destruction → hepatitis and liver [[cirrhosis|cirrhosis]]
	- Effect on the lungs: deficient AAT → uninhibited neutrophil elastase activity → destruction of the pulmonary parenchyma → [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|panacinar emphysema]]

# Clinical features
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Pulmonary manifestations </span>
	- Cough, wheezing
	- Dyspnea
	- Diminished breath sounds
	- Barrel chest

 >Adolescents presenting with pulmonary symptoms without a history of smoking should raise suspicion for AAT deficiency.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hepatic manifestations</span>
	- Prolonged [[neonatal jaundice|neonatal jaundice]]
	- Hepatitis
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[Cirrhosis|Cirrhosis]]</span>
	- Increased risk of [[hepatocellular carcinoma|hepatocellular carcinoma]] (HCC)
		- Patients with AAT deficiency are at risk of developing liver [[cirrhosis|cirrhosis]] with subsequent HCC. HCC can also develop in the absence of [[cirrhosis|cirrhosis]].

# Diagnostics
- Serum: decreased antitrypsin protein levels
- Electrophoresis: decreased alpha-1 peak  
- Chest x-ray 
	- Low and flat diaphragm
	- Widened intercostal spaces
	- Hyperinflation and increased basilar radiolucency of both lungs with rarification of peripheral pulmonary vessels
- Chest CT 
	- [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|Panacinar emphysema]] (in contrast to centriacinar emphysema in smoking-related emphysema)
	- [[Bronchiectasis|Bronchiectasis]]
	- Bullae
- Liver biopsy
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">PAS-positive</span>, spherical inclusion bodies in periportal hepatocytes![[Pasted image 20231029101651.png|Pasted image 20231029101651.png]]
