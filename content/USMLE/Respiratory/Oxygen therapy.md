## Oxygen-induced hypercapnia
- **Overview**
    - PaCO2 > 45 mm Hg or a rise of > 5 mm Hg in a chronically hypercapnic patient
    - One of the most common and serious complications of oxygen therapy
    - Can be fatal if left untreated.
- **Mechanism**
    - Thought to predominantly occur via a combination of two mechanisms when supplemental oxygen is administered:![[L29660.jpg|L29660.jpg]]
        - <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↓ Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction: ↑ FiO2 → ↑ alveolar O2 tension → ↓ hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction → ↑ V/Q mismatch and hypercapnia</span>
        - <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Haldane effect: ↑ FiO2 → ↑ oxygenated Hb, which has a reduced affinity to bind CO2 (right shift in the CO2 dissociation curve) → CO2 being released from Hb and RBCs → ↑ PaCO2</span>
- **Risk factors**
    - Any patient with risk factors for hypercapnic respiratory failure who is receiving supplemental oxygen
    - PaO2 is > 75 mm Hg
    - Acute illness or new oxygen therapy in patients with chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure
- **Management**
    - **Gradually** titrate oxygen back to 88–92%.
    - Noninvasive ventilation in patients with decompensated hypercapnic respiratory failure who are within target saturations.
- **Prevention**
    - Close monitoring for symptoms of hypercapnia.
    - Patients at risk of hypercapnic respiratory failure: ABGs should be performed if drowsiness or other symptoms of hypercapnia develop, if saturations deteriorate, or if acute breathlessness occurs.
