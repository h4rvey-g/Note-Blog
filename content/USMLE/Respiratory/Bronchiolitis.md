---
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Primarily affects children &lt; 2 years of age</span>
- Peak incidence: 2â€“6 months of age
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Common during winter months</span>
- Risk factors are the same as risk factors for severe RSV infection in children.

# Etiology
---
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Most common: respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)</span>, a paramyxovirus
- Less common
	- Parainfluenza virus

# Pathophysiology

# Clinical features
---
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Initially, URTI symptoms (e.g., copious rhinorrhea, low-grade fever, cough) </span>
- Followed by LRTI symptoms 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Crackles, wheezes, and/or rhonchi on auscultation</span>
		- Wheezing in bronchiolitis is <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">diffuse, polyphonic and classically "musical" in nature.</span> Wheezing in asthma is more monophonic and improves with bronchodilator administration.
	- Severe illness: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">respiratory distress (usually occurs in children &lt; 1 year of age)</span>
		- Due to mucous obstruction of the bronchioles, which are very small in children < 2 years of age
		- Tachypnea or apnea 
		- Prolonged expiration
		- Nasal flaring
		- Intercostal retractions
		- Cyanosis
