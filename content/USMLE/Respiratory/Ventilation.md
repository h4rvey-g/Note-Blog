- Respiratory rate (RR): number of breaths per minute
- Tidal volume (VT): the volume of air that is inspired or expired in a single breath
- Minute ventilation (VE)
	- Volume of air that a person breathes per minute
	- VE = VT x RR
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Physiologic dead space (VD): volume of inspired air that does not participate in gas exchange </span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">VD is the sum of the anatomic dead space and the alveolar dead space.</span>
		- Anatomic dead space: the volume of air in the conducting zone, e.g., mouth, trachea (approx. ⅓ of the resting tidal volume)
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Alveolar dead space: the sum of the volumes of alveoli that do not participate in gas exchange (mainly apex of the lungs); These alveoli are ventilated but not perfused.</span>
	- Bohr equation determines the physiologic dead space: VD = VT x (PaCO<sub>2</sub> - PeCO<sub>2</sub>)/(PaCO<sub>2</sub>) 
	- In a healthy lung, VD equals the anatomic dead space (normal value: approx. 150 mL/breath).
- Alveolar ventilation (VA)
	- Volume of gas that reaches the alveoli each minute
	- VA = (VT - VD) x RR

# Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)
---
- Definition
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Positive pressure in the lung maintained over the entire inhalation and expiration phases</span>
- Mechanism of action: keeps airway pressure above the atmospheric level <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">at the end of exhalation</span> → increases alveolar pressure and volume → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">reopens collapsed or unstable alveoli</span> → improves ventilation/perfusion relation
- Indications: PEEP is typically justified when a PaO2 of 60 mm Hg cannot be achieved with an FiO2 of 60%.
	- Almost all patients need a minimum amount of PEEP (3–5 cm H2O).
	- Higher PEEP is indicated in conditions involving a right-to-left pulmonary shunt pathology.
- Advantages
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Prevent [[atelectasis|atelectasis]]</span>
	- ↑ Oxygenation without increasing the risk of oxygen toxicity
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↑ Gas exchange area</span>
	- ↑ Functional residual capacity
	- ↑ Pulmonary compliance
