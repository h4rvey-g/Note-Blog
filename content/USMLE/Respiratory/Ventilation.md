- Respiratory rate (RR): number of breaths per minute
- Tidal volume (VT): the volume of air that is inspired or expired in a single breath
- Minute ventilation (VE)
	- Volume of air that a person breathes per minute
	- VE = VT x RR
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Physiologic dead space (VD): volume of inspired air that does not participate in gas exchange </span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">VD is the sum of the anatomic dead space and the alveolar dead space.</span>
		- Anatomic dead space: the volume of air in the conducting zone, e.g., mouth, trachea (approx. â…“ of the resting tidal volume)
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Alveolar dead space: the sum of the volumes of alveoli that do not participate in gas exchange (mainly apex of the lungs); These alveoli are ventilated but not perfused.</span>
	- Bohr equation determines the physiologic dead space: VD = VT x (PaCO<sub>2</sub> - PeCO<sub>2</sub>)/(PaCO<sub>2</sub>) 
	- In a healthy lung, VD equals the anatomic dead space (normal value: approx. 150 mL/breath).
- Alveolar ventilation (VA)
	- Volume of gas that reaches the alveoli each minute
	- VA = (VT - VD) x RR
