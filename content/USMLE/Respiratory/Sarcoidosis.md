# Etiology

# Pathophysiology
Sarcoidosis is a systemic disorder characterized by widespread, immune-mediated formation of <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">noncaseating granulomas</span>.
- General
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Inhalation of foreign antigen</span> → monocyte differentiation → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">activation of interstitial dendritic cells and alveolar macrophages</span>
	- Interstitial dendritic cells migrate towards mediastinal lymph nodes and alveolar macrophages differentiate, serving as antigen-presenting cells to circulating T helper (Th) cells → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">differentiation and clonal expansion of T cells</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">T cell recruitment and ↑ B-cell activity → local immune hyperactivity and inflammation → formation of noncaseating granulomas in the lungs and the lymphatic system</span>
- [[Granulomatous inflammation|Granuloma]] formation: Mature granulomas are composed of epithelioid cells and macrophages surrounded by lymphocytes and fibroblasts.
	- Macrophages activate Th1 cells. 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Th1 cells stimulate the formation of epithelioid cells and multinucleated giant cells by releasing IFN-γ.</span>![[Pasted image 20240222102853.png|Pasted image 20240222102853.png]]
	- Epithelioid cells produce angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and release cytokines that recruit more immune cells.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Asteroid bodies: star-shaped, eosinophilic inclusion bodies consisting of various lipids (e.g., from sarcoidosis, foreign body reactions)</span>![[Pasted image 20230807213802.png|Pasted image 20230807213802.png]]

- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Fibrosis</span>: Epithelioid cells secrete cytokines to recruit fibroblasts, leading to fibrosis → damage of organs and tissue
- Calcium dysregulation: activated pulmonary alveolar macrophages → ↑ 1-alpha hydroxylase expression and activity → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↑ 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol) → hypervitaminosis D → hyperphosphatemia, [[hypercalcemia|hypercalcemia]], and, possibly, renal failure</span>

# Clinical features
## Pulmonary sarcoidosis
- Lungs are the most commonly affected organ (90% of affected individuals).
- Often asymptomatic in the early stages
- Classic finding is hilar lymphadenopathy![[Pasted image 20230803213638.png|Pasted image 20230803213638.png]]
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Interstitial fibrosis</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Cough, exertional dyspnea, chest pain</span>
	- Mild rales on pulmonary auscultation
## Extrapulmonary sarcoidosis
### Cutaneous sarcoidosis
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[Erythema nodosum|Erythema nodosum]]</span>: most common nonspecific cutaneous manifestation 
![[Pasted image 20230720153101.png|Pasted image 20230720153101.png]]
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Lupus pernio</span>
	- A pathognomonic manifestation of sarcoidosis characterized by extensive, violaceous skin plaques (i.e., epithelioid granulomas of the dermis) on the nose, cheeks, chin, and/or ears 

Butterfly rash as seen in [[systemic lupus erythematosus|systemic lupus erythematosus]]
### Neurosarcoidosis
- Cranial nerve palsy (unilateral or bilateral <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">facial nerve palsy is the most common</span>)
- [[Diabetes insipidus|Diabetes insipidus]]
### Ocular sarcoidosis
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Sarcoid uveitis</span> 
	- Most common ocular manifestation
	- Manifests with pain, redness, and photophobia

# Diagnostics
>[!tip] 
>Increased ACE levels may be seen. However, they are not specific for sarcoidosis and should not be used in isolation for diagnosis or monitoring.

## Imaging
- Chest x-ray
	- Preferred initial test for all patients with suspected sarcoidosis
	- Classic findings: bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">with or without pulmonary infiltrates</span> (i.e., reticular and/or <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">ground glass opacities</span>)![[Pasted image 20230803213638.png|Pasted image 20230803213638.png]]![[Pasted image 20240109153322.png|Pasted image 20240109153322.png]]
## Biopsy
- Schaumann bodies: cellular inclusion bodies consisting of intracytoplasmic calcium and protein with laminar stratification (e.g., sarcoidosis, [[tuberculosis|tuberculosis]], [[Crohn disease|Crohn disease]], berylliosis)![[Pasted image 20231103144254.png|Pasted image 20231103144254.png]]
## Additional studies
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL):↑ CD4:CD8 ratio</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">CD4+ lymphocytes release [[Interferons and Tumor necrosis factor|interferon]]-gamma and TNF-alpha to drive macrophage activation and [[Granulomatous inflammation|granuloma]] formation.</span>
