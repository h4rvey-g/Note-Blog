# Gas exchange

## Types of gas exchange 
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Perfusion-limited gas exchange: Gas exchange is limited by the rate of blood flow through the pulmonary capillaries.</span>
	- Gases (e.g., O2, CO2, N2O) can diffuse freely across the blood-air barrier.
	- The concentration of gases in the plasma will become equal to the concentration in the alveoli before the blood reaches the end of the capillary. 
	- An increase in blood flow causes an increase in gas exchange .
	- Occurrence: under normal conditions (i.e., at rest)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Diffusion-limited gas exchange: Gas exchange is limited by the diffusion rate of the gas (e.g., O2, CO) across the blood-air barrier.</span> 
	- The gas concentration in the plasma will not be in equilibrium at the end of the capillary.
	- Occurrence
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Strenuous exercise</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">In certain pathological conditions that affect the blood-air barrier (e.g., emphysema, lung fibrosis)</span>

>[!tip] 
>Under normal physiological conditions, O2 transport is generally perfusion-limited, while it can become diffusion-limited in pathological states or during intense exercise.

1. Bronchi: all
2. Bronchioles
	- No cartilage
	- Pseudostratified epithelium → Simple epithelium
		- &ndash; Globlet cells and basal cells
		- &#43; Club cells
3. Terminal bronchioles
	- Columnar ciliated cells → Cuboidal ciliated cells
4. Respiratory bronchioles
	- &#43; Squamous cells
5. Alveolar sacs
	- All gone
