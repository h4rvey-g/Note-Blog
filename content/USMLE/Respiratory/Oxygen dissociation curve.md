>When oxygen supply is insufficient, the body initially reduces the affinity of red blood cells for oxygen, ensuring adequate oxygen supply to peripheral tissues.
- Causes of shift to the right include:
	- ↑ Partial pressure of carbon dioxide (↑ PCO<sub>2</sub>) 
	- ↑ Body temperature (e.g., fever)
	- ↑ H<sup>+</sup> (↓ pH)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↑ 2,3-BPG (generated by 2,3-BPG mutase during erythrocyte [[glycolysis|glycolysis]])</span>
		- 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG) concentrations <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">increase in erythrocytes when oxygen availability is reduced</span>, as occurs in chronic lung disease, [[heart failure|heart failure]], and chronic exposure to high altitudes.
		- 2,3-BPG is <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">synthesized from glycolytic intermediates and binds strongly to deoxyhemoglobin</span> in a pocket formed between the 2 beta chains.  <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">This binding reduces the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin, allowing more oxygen to diffuse into the peripheral tissues.</span>  The hemoglobin 2,3-BPG binding pocket contains positively charged amino acids (eg, histidine and lysine) that attract the negatively charged phosphate groups in 2,3-BPG.  Mutations that decrease the positive charge of the binding site decrease 2,3-BPG binding and increase hemoglobin oxygen affinity.
			- During normal [[glycolysis|glycolysis]], ATP is generated when 1,3-BPG is converted to 3-phosphoglycerate by the enzyme phosphoglycerate kinase.  However, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">erythrocytes can bypass this part of the pathway using bisphosphoglycerate mutase, an enzyme that converts 1,3-BPG to 2,3-BPG in a step that produces no ATP.</span>![[L27941.jpg|L27941.jpg]]
	- ↑ Exercise
	- ↑ Altitude
- Causes of shift to the left include:
	- ↓ Partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO<sub>2</sub>)
	- ↓ Body temperature
	- ↓ H<sup>+</sup> (↑ pH)
	- ↓ 2,3-BPG (e.g., due to mutations in the BPGM gene on chromosome 7) 
	- ↑ CO
	- ↑ Methemoglobin
	- ↑ Fetal [[Hemoglobin variants|hemoglobin]] (HbF)
