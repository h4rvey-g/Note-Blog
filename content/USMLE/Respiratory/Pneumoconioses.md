## Asbestosis
- Etiology: Airborne asbestos fibers
- Population at risk: 
	- Asbestos miners and millers
	- Brake linings and insulation manufactures
	- Ship construction workers
	- Demolishers
- Clinical features: 
	- Symptoms typically develop 15–20 years after initial exposure.
	- Exertional dyspnea
	- Dry cough that transforms into productive cough
	- Digital clubbing
	- Ferruginous bodies in alveolar septa on histology 
		- asbestos fiber becomes coated with iron and calcium![[Pasted image 20230727171328.png|Pasted image 20230727171328.png]]
		> Ingestion of these fibers by macrophages sets off a fibrogenic response via release of growth factors that promote collagen deposition by fibroblasts.
	- Complications
		- [[Lung cancer|Lung cancer]] (smoking increases the risk): <mark style="background: #FFF3A34A;">bronchogenic carcinoma is most common</mark>
		- [[Mesothelioma|Mesothelioma]]: rarely occurs without a history of asbestos exposure
- Chest x-ray: 
	- Diffuse bilateral infiltrates predominantly in the lower lobes
	- Interstitial fibrosis
	- Calcified pleural plaques (usually indicate benign pleural disease)![[Pasted image 20230727171235.png|Pasted image 20230727171235.png]]

	> This is the causative agent for asbestosis, a long, thin asbestos fiber. Some houses, business locations, and ships still contain building products with asbestos, particularly insulation materials, so care must be taken when doing remodelling or reconstruction.
## Silicosis
- Etiology
	- Inhalation of crystalline silica, most commonly as dust
	- High-risk occupations for the development of silicosis include sandblasting, mining, and working in foundries

>[!Mnemonic] 
>To remember the high-risk occupations for the development of silicosis, think “I found (foundries) sand (sandblasting) on my (mining) window sill (silicosis)!”

- Clinical features
	- Chronic cough (often with sputum) and exertional dyspnea
	- Caplan syndrome: pneumoconiosis in combination with rheumatoid arthritis; characterized by rapid development of basilar nodules and mild obstruction of ventilation
- Chest x-ray
	- Eggshell calcification: well-defined sickle-shaped calcification of the rims of hilar lymph nodes![[Pasted image 20230805164438.png|Pasted image 20230805164438.png]]
	- Bilateral diffuse ground glass opacities
	- Large number of rounded, solitary, small (≤ 1 cm in diameter) opacities particularly in the <mark style="background: #FFF3A34A;">upper lobe of the lungs</mark>
