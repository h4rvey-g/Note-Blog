## Asbestosis
- Etiology: Airborne asbestos fibers
- Population at risk: 
	- Asbestos miners and millers
	- Brake linings and insulation manufactures
	- Ship construction workers
	- Demolishers
- Clinical features: 
	- Symptoms typically develop 15–20 years after initial exposure.
	- Exertional dyspnea
	- Dry cough that transforms into productive cough
	- Digital clubbing
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Ferruginous bodies</span> in alveolar septa on histology![[Pasted image 20241026111108.png|Pasted image 20241026111108.png]]
	- Complications
		- [[Lung cancer|Lung cancer]] (smoking increases the risk):<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">bronchogenic carcinoma is most common</span>
		- [[Mesothelioma|Mesothelioma]]: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">rarely occurs</span> without a history of asbestos exposure
- Chest x-ray: 
	- Diffuse bilateral infiltrates predominantly in the lower lobes
	- Interstitial fibrosis
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Calcified pleural plaques</span> (usually indicate benign pleural disease)![[L29321.jpg|L29321.jpg]]![[Pasted image 20230727171235.png|Pasted image 20230727171235.png]]
 - Microscopic
	 - ![[Pasted image 20230805163027.png|Pasted image 20230805163027.png]]
	> This is the causative agent for asbestosis, a long, thin asbestos fiber. Some houses, business locations, and ships still contain building products with asbestos, particularly insulation materials, so care must be taken when doing remodelling or reconstruction.
## Silicosis
- Etiology
	- Inhalation of crystalline silica, most commonly as dust
	- High-risk occupations for the development of silicosis include sandblasting, mining, and working in foundries

>The <font color="#ffc000">silly egg sand</font>wich I <font color="#ffc000">found</font> is <font color="#ffc000">mine</font>!

- Clinical features
	- Chronic cough (often with sputum) and exertional dyspnea
	- Caplan syndrome: pneumoconiosis in combination with rheumatoid arthritis; characterized by rapid development of basilar nodules and mild obstruction of ventilation
- Chest x-ray
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Eggshell calcification</span>: well-defined sickle-shaped calcification of the rims of hilar lymph nodes![[Pasted image 20230805164438.png|Pasted image 20230805164438.png]]
	- Bilateral diffuse ground glass opacities
	- Large number of rounded, solitary, small (≤ 1 cm in diameter) opacities particularly in the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">upper lobe of the lungs</span>
