# Airway resistance
- Intermediate-size bronchi, especially the segmental bronchi, are the greatest contributors to total airway resistance because of their low total cross-sectional area![[Pasted image 20230805182633.png|Pasted image 20230805182633.png]]

>Airway resistance is lowest in the small airways due to a large number of parallel bronchioles, while the highest airway resistance is in the larger airways (trachea, bronchi).
