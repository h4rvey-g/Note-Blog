- **Phase 0 trial**
    - Purpose: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Exploratory phase with no therapeutic or diagnostic intent, aimed at gaining insight into pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.</span>
    - <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Only &lt; ​1% of the therapeutic dose is used.</span>
    - Safety and toxicity are not assessed.
    - Study population: Small sample consisting of either healthy individuals or a population with a disease of interest (∼ 10–15).
    - Study design: Open-label.
- **Phase I trial**
    - Purpose: Evaluation of pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of the drug, safety, and toxicity.
    - <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Evaluation of the maximum tolerated dose.</span>
    - Study population: Small number of healthy individuals or patients with a specific disease (∼ 15–30).
    - Study design: Open-label.
- **Phase II trial**
    - Purpose: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Evaluation of efficacy, optimal dose range, and side effects (especially common and short-term side effects).</span>
    - Study population: Moderate number of patients with a specific disease (∼ 10–100).
    - Study design: Randomized, Controlled, Anonymized.
- **Phase III trial**
    - Purpose: Final confirmation of safety and evaluation of efficacy <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">against placebo or the current standard of care</span>.
    - Study population: Randomized control trial with a large number of patients with a specific disease (∼ 100–1000).
    - Study design: Randomized Controlled Trial.
- **Phase IV trial**
    - Purpose: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Postmarketing surveillance</span>, comparing real-life efficacy to that described in research studies. Safety studies following approval (especially <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">evaluation of rare and long-term side effects</span>).
    - Study population: Large number of patients with a specific disease after drug approval.
    - Study design: Open-label.
