- Phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors are a heterogenic class of drugs that target various isoforms of PDE enzymes. 
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Normally, the PDE decreases cAMP or [[Signal transduction|cGMP]] in target cells by catalyzing the hydrolysis of these second messengers. </span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">By inhibiting this step, PDE inhibitors actually increase cAMP and/or [[Signal transduction|cGMP]] concentrations. </span>
- They are classified according to their target isoforms as nonspecific, PDE5, PDE4, and PDE3 inhibitors, each of which has a different clinical use.
# Nonspecific phosphodiesterase inhibitors (inhibitors of PDE3, 4, and 5)

- Theophylline
## Indications
- [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|COPD]] (severe and refractory cases)
- [[Asthma|Asthma]]
## Adverse effects
- General considerations
	- Close drug monitoring due to <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">narrow therapeutic index (high risk of overdose).</span>
	- Metabolized in the liver by the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[cytochrome P450|cytochrome P450]] oxidase system.</span>
		- ↑ Risk of drug interactions (e.g., ciprofloxacin can increase theophylline serum levels).
- Cardiotoxicity
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Tachycardia, arrhythmias</span>
- Neurotoxicity (dosage-dependent)
	- At low levels of overdose: dizziness, lightheadedness, headache
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">At high levels of overdose: seizures</span>
- Gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity
	- Severe refractory nausea and vomiting
	- [[Diarrhea|Diarrhea]]
	- Abdominal pain

## Antiplatelets
- Agents
	- Cilostazol
	- Dipyridamole
- Indications
	- Intermittent vascular claudication
	- Antiplatelet (antianginal, TIA/stroke prevention)
	- Coronary stent restenosis prophylaxis
## [[Heart failure|Heart failure]] drugs
- Agent: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Milrinone</span>
- Indications
	- Acute treatment of <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">decompensated cardiac failure with cardiogenic shock</span>
- Mechanisms
	- Inhibition of smooth muscle proliferation
	- PDE3 inhibition → ↑ cAMP 
		- In the myocardium: ↑ cAMP → activation of calcium channels → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">cardiostimulatory effects → ↑ inotropy and ↑ chronotropy</span>
		- In peripheral vessels: ↑ cAMP → inhibition of myosin light chain kinase → smooth muscle relaxation → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">vasodilation with reduced cardiovascular preload and afterload</span>
