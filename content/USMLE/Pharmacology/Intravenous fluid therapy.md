- **Tonicity**
	- **Isotonic**
		- **Fluid type**
			- 0.9% (normal) saline
			- Lactated Ringer solution
			- Albumin (5% or 25%)
				- Colloid solution; all other listed fluid types are crystalloid solutions.
		- **Clinical use**
			- Volume resuscitation (e.g., hypovolemia, shock)
			- Volume replacement, treatment of SBP or HRS
				- HRS = hepatorenal syndrome; SBP = spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
	- **Hypotonic**
		- **Fluid type**
			- Dextrose 5% in water
				- Dextrose 5% in water (initially slightly hypotonic) & dextrose 5% in 0.45% saline (initially hypertonic) become markedly hypotonic due to metabolism of glucose.
			- 0.45% (half-normal) saline
			- Dextrose 5% in 0.45% (half-normal) saline
		- **Clinical use**
			- Free water deficit
			- Maintenance hydration
	- **Hypertonic**
		- **Fluid type**
			- 3% (hypertonic) saline
		- **Clinical use**
