- The underlying mechanism responsible for the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">decreased effect of a drug involves depletion of the body's stores of an endogenous mediator and downregulation of receptors.</span>
- Cannot be overcome by increasing the drug dose.
- Develops quickly (within a few hours of dosing)
- Examples include:
	- Nitrates
	- Hydralazine
	- Indirect sympathomimetic drugs (e.g., ephedrine)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Direct sympathomimetic drugs (e.g., phenylephrine, niacin, LSD, MDMA ): the response to the repeated use of nasal decongestants (e.g., oxymetazoline) reduces the response over a short period of time and may cause rebound congestion</span>
