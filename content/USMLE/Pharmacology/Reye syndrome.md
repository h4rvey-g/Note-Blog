- Description: a rare type of <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">hepatic encephalopathy</span> that is associated with <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">aspirin use for viral illness in children</span> < 19 years ![[Pasted image 20231023105815.png|Pasted image 20231023105815.png]]
- Etiology: aspirin use in individuals < 19 years of age with a febrile illness
- Pathophysiology
	- Viruses alter the metabolism of salicylates  → accumulation of salicylate metabolites in the liver → mitochondrial injury and reversible inhibition of enzymes required for [[fatty acid oxidation|fatty acid oxidation]] → failure of hepatic ATP production → acute hepatic failure → [[hyperammonemia|hyperammonemia]], metabolic acidosis, and hepatic steatosis → acute encephalopathy
	- [[Hyperammonemia|Hyperammonemia]] → cerebral edema → ↑ ICP
- Clinical features
	- Preceding viral infection (e.g., [[influenza|influenza]], varicella or viral gastroenteritis): The first symptoms of Reye syndrome usually begin 3–5 days after a viral illness.
	- Acute encephalopathy
		- Severe vomiting 
		- Altered mental status (ranging from lethargy to [[delirium|delirium]] and coma)
		- Neurological symptoms (e.g., seizures, fixed pupils)
	- Liver failure
		- Fatty degeneration
		- [[Hepatomegaly|Hepatomegaly]]
- Prevention
	- Aspirin should be avoided in individuals < 19 years of age, especially those with fever.
	- Exception: children with [[Kawasaki disease|Kawasaki disease]]
