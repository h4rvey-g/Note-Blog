# Depolarizing NMJ blockers (depolarizing muscle relaxants)
---
## Monitoring
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Train-of-four stimulation shows an equal decrease in the amplitude of all 4 muscle twitches.</span>
	- The muscle fiber becomes unresponsive to any further stimulation![[L10321.jpg|L10321.jpg]]
# Nondepolarizing NMJ blockers (nondepolarizing muscle relaxants)
---
## Mechanism of action
- Compete with ACh to bind with the (nicotinic) ACh receptors at the motor end plate (<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">competitive antagonists</span>) â†’ <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">prevention of motor end plate depolarization (nondepolarization block)</span>
## Agents
- Rocuronium 
- Vecuronium 
- Atracurium
## Indications
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Rapid-sequence induction of anesthesia</span> when succinylcholine is contraindicated
## Monitoring
- Train-of-four stimulation shows a fade-off in the amplitude of the muscle twitch
	- NDMRs block nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) not only at the postsynaptic membrane <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">but also at presynaptic nerve terminals</span>
	- These presynaptic receptors n<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">ormally provide positive feedback for additional ACh release</span>
	- When blocked, there's <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">reduced mobilization of ACh vesicles for subsequent stimuli</span>
