# Epidemiology


---
# Etiology
- Idiopathic inflammatory autoimmune disorder of unknown etiology
- Risk factors include:
	- Genetic disposition: associated with [[HLA system|HLA-DR4]] and HLA-DR1
	- Environmental factors (e.g., smoking)
	- Hormonal factors (premenopausal women are at the highest risk, suggesting a predisposing role of female sex hormones)

# Pathophysiology
- Certain interstitial tissue proteins (e.g. intracellular filament protein vimentin, filaggrin, type II collagen) <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">undergo a posttranslational modification</span> that involves the conversion of arginine to citrulline (citrullination). 
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Citrullinated proteins are recognized as foreign by the antigen-presenting cells that present them to CD4+ T cells.</span>
- Activation of CD4+ T cells leads to the following sequences of events: 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">IL-4 production</span> → B-cell proliferation and differentiation → production of <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">anticitrullinated peptide antibodies</span> → type II hypersensitivity reaction and [[Type III hypersensitivity reactions|type III hypersensitivity reaction]]
	- Migration of CD4+ T cells to synovial joints → secretion of cytokines <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">([[Interferons|IFN-γ]], IL-17)</span> → recruitment of macrophages → secretion of cytokines (<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">TNF-α, IL-1</span>, IL-6) → inflammation and proliferation
- Bouts of inflammation, angiogenesis, and proliferation → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">proliferative granulation tissue with mononuclear inflammatory cells → pannus and synovial hypertrophy → invasion, progressive destruction, and deterioration of cartilage and bone</span>
- Antibodies against Fc portion of IgG (rheumatoid factor, RF) are produced to aid in removing autoantibodies and immune complexes.
	- RF excess triggers formation of new immune complexes and [[Type III hypersensitivity reactions|type III HSR]]
	- Individuals with positive RF are more likely to develop extraarticular manifestations.

# Clinical features
![[Pasted image 20240221152545.png|Pasted image 20240221152545.png]]
## Extraarticular manifestations
- Rheumatoid nodules
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Skin</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Nontender, firm, subcutaneous swellings</span> (2 mm–5 cm) 
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Commonly occur in areas exposed to higher pressure, e.g., extensor side of the forearm, bony prominences</span>![[Pasted image 20240227143305.png|Pasted image 20240227143305.png]]
	- Lungs
		- Typically bilateral and peripheral
		- Rheumatoid pulmonary nodules may be accompanied by fibrosis and pneumoconiosis (Caplan syndrome).

# Subtypes and variants
---
## Atlantoaxial subluxation (Vertebral subluxation)
- Definition: a potentially life-threatening complication caused by the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">inflammatory destruction of the ligaments affecting the atlantoaxial joint and the intervertebral joints</span>
- Clinical features
	- Pain and stiffness of the neck (typically early-morning neck pain at rest)
	- Head tilt
	- Neurological deficits
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Cervical radiculopathy with peripheral paresthesias of the upper limb</span>
		- In some cases, symptoms of high spinal cord compression
			- Slowly progressive spastic quadriparesis
			- Hyperreflexia or positive Babinski reflex
			- Respiratory insufficiency
- Diagnostics
	- Extension and flexion x-rays of the cervical spine
	- MRI 

>[!warning] 
>Endotracheal intubation can acutely worsen the subluxation and cause compression of the spinal cord and/or vertebral arteries.

- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Anticitrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPA), e.g., anticyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) </span>
	- Tissue inflammation causes arginine residues in proteins such as vimentin to be enzymatically converted into citrulline through a process called citrullination.  This alters the shape of the proteins, which can then serve as neoantigens that generate an immune response.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Rheumatoid factor (RF): IgM autoantibodies against the Fc region of IgG antibodies</span>
# Differential diagnostics
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[Parvovirus B19|Parvovirus B19]] will presents with similar symptoms, except for rash, normal ESR, and acute onset</span>

# Treatment
## Acute anti-inflammatory treatment
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Glucocorticoids</span>
	- Systemic prednisone
		- Longer-term therapy: Only use in patients with highly active RA
- [[Non-opioid analgesics|NSAIDs]] and selective COX-2 inhibitors: relieve symptoms, but do not improve the prognosis
## Long-term pharmacological treatment
### Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Methotrexate (MTX): first-line treatment in patients with moderate to high disease activity</span>
	- To minimize adverse effects, administer folic acid.
#### Biologic DMARDs
- Indication: persistent moderate or severe disease activity after 3 months of conventional DMARD therapy 
- Agents
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">TNF-α inhibitors</span>: e.g., adalimumab, infliximab, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">etanercept</span>
