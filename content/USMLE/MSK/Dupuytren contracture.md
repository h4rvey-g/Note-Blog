# Epidemiology
---
- Peak incidence: 40–60 years

# Etiology
---
- Risk factors
	- Recurrent trauma (e.g., use of pneumatic tools used in construction, manual labor)
	- Alcohol abuse
	- Liver [[cirrhosis|cirrhosis]]

# Pathophysiology
---
- Dupuytren contracture (palmar fibromatosis) is a fibroproliferative disorder of the palmar fascia
- Injury (trauma/ischemia) to the palmar fascia triggers myofibroblasts → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">fibroblast proliferation and [[collagen|collagen]] ([[collagen|collagen]] type III) deposition  → thickening of the palmar fascia → formation of nodules in the palmar fascia</span>
- The nodules are adherent to the overlying dermis → characteristic puckering of palmar skin

# Clinical features
---
- The 4th and 5th fingers are most commonly involved 
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Skin puckering near the proximal flexor crease: earliest sign </span>![[highresdefault_L33809.png|highresdefault_L33809.png]]
- Palmar nodule 
- Palmar cords 
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Flexion contracture of affected fingers </span>
