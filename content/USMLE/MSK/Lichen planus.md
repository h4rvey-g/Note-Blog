<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Lichen planus is a chronic inflammatory disease of unknown origin</span>, which most commonly affects individuals between 30–60 years of age and is characterized by different types of lesions involving the skin and mucosa.
# Epidemiology

# Etiology
---
- Associated with [[hepatitis C|hepatitis C]] infections

# Pathophysiology

# Clinical features
---
## Cutaneous lichen planus
- <font color="#ffc000">5 "Ps": pruritic, purple/pink, polygonal, papules & plaques</font>
- Lesions 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Purple, well-demarcated papules or plaques</span>![[Pasted image 20240228103532.png|Pasted image 20240228103532.png]]![[L50717.jpg|L50717.jpg]]
	- Planar (flat-topped)
	- Polygonal, irregular borders
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Pruritic, often severe</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Wickham striae: white, reticular lines on the surface of mucosal lesions</span> 
- Distribution pattern
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Affects the extremities, especially the ankles and flexor wrists, as well as the trunk</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Bilateral, symmetrical distribution</span>

## Pathology
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hyperkeratosis</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Wedge-shaped hypergranulosis </span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Irregular acanthosis (saw-tooth appearance) </span>
- Band-like lymphocytic infiltrate at the dermal-epidermal junction![[L76059.png|L76059.png]]

# Differential Diagnostics

>[!tip] [[Psoriasis|Psoriasis]] vs Lichen planus
>- Immune Mechanism:
>	- Lichen Planus primarily involves <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">CD8+ T cells targeting basal keratinocytes</span>, creating a band-like lymphocytic infiltrate at the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">dermo-epidermal junction</span> and interface dermatitis
>	- [[Psoriasis|Psoriasis]] is driven by Th17/Th1 cells and <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">involves complex cytokine cascades</span> (IL-17, IL-22, TNF-α), affecting the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">entire epidermis</span> and leading to neutrophil recruitment
>- Keratinocyte Response:
>	- Lichen Planus shows <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">normal to slow keratinocyte turnover</span>, allowing time for proper differentiation, resulting in <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">hypergranulosis (increased keratohyalin granules)</span>
>		- Because of immune stress?
>	- [[Psoriasis|Psoriasis]] exhibits <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">extremely rapid keratinocyte turnover</span> (3-5 days vs normal 28-30 days), <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">preventing proper differentiation, leading to loss of granular layer and parakeratosis</span>
