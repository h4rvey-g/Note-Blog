An injury to the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">lateral femoral cutaneous nerve</span> that results in pain and paresthesias of the outer thigh.![[highresdefault_L8619.jpg|highresdefault_L8619.jpg]]
- MP presents with pain, paresthesia, and numbness in the lateral thigh above the knee.  However, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">strength is normal</span> because the LFCN does not contain motor fibers. 
- Common causes
	- Compression at the level of the inguinal ligament, caused by:
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Increased intraabdominal pressure (e.g., pregnancy, uterine fibroids, obesity, ascites)</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">External compression (from, e.g., tight belts, pants, or compression dressings, trauma to the anterior superior iliac spine)</span>
		- Local compression (due to, e.g., tumors, muscle compression from prolonged sitting or standing, hematomas)
	- Pelvic surgery
