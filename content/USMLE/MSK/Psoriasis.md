# Epidemiology
---


# Etiology
---
- Trigger factors
	- Infectious
		- Infections of the upper respiratory tract caused by β-hemolytic streptococci
			- A possible explanation is molecular mimicry, as the M protein of streptococci closely resembles the keratin of the skin.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Mechanical irritation</span>
	- Drugs (e.g., [[Beta blockers|beta-blockers]], chloroquine, lithium, interferon)

# Pathophysiology
---
- Increased proliferation of keratinocytes 
	- Normally, the epidermis takes about 26–28 days to completely renew itself. This process involves the formation of new keratinocytes and shedding of aged (keratotic) skin cells. In individuals with psoriasis, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">the proliferation rate increases five-fold to ten-fold.</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Acanthosis: thickening of the epidermis = typical erythematous plaques</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Parakeratosis: retention of nucleated keratinocytes in the [[Skin layers|stratum corneum]] = characteristic silvery scales</span>
- T cells secrete cytokines, which mediate an inflammatory response.![[L44062.jpg|L44062.jpg]]

# Clinical features
---
## Cutaneous lesions
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Well-demarcated, erythematous plaques and/or papules with silver-white scaling</span>![[Pasted image 20240227155147.png|Pasted image 20240227155147.png]]
- Located mainly on the scalp, trunk, elbows, and knees (extensor surfaces)![[Pasted image 20240227155212.png|Pasted image 20240227155212.png]]
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Pruritus in ∼ 80% of cases</span>
- Characteristic features may be present.
	- Auspitz sign 
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Small pinpoint bleeding when scales are scraped off</span>
		- Removal of the scales exposes the dermal papillae, which leads to bleeding.
	- Koebner phenomenon: Physical stimuli or skin injury (e.g., trauma, scratching, irritating clothing) can lead to the appearance of psoriatic skin lesions on previously unaffected skin (isomorphic response).
## Nail involvement
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Nail pitting: small, round depressions in the nail</span> 
- Brittle nails: nail dystrophy with crumbling of the nail
- Onycholysis: partial and mostly distal separation of the nail plate 


# Diagnostics
---
## Skin biopsy
- Indications: Consider only if clinical presentation is atypical.
- Supportive findings![[highresdefault_L89584.png|highresdefault_L89584.png]]
	- Acanthosis and parakeratosis
	- Thickening of the [[Skin layers|stratum spinosum]], thinning of the [[Skin layers|stratum granulosum]]
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Acanthosis = typical erythematous plaques</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Parakeratosis = characteristic silvery scales</span>
	- Munro microabscesses: accumulation of neutrophils in the [[Skin layers|stratum corneum]] surrounded by parakeratosis

vs [[Lichen planus|Lichen planus]]![[Pasted image 20240228105319.png|Pasted image 20240228105319.png]]
>[!tip] Psoriasis vs Lichen planus
>- Immune Mechanism:
>	- Lichen Planus primarily involves <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">CD8+ T cells targeting basal keratinocytes</span>, creating a band-like lymphocytic infiltrate at the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">dermo-epidermal junction</span> and interface dermatitis
>	- Psoriasis is driven by Th17/Th1 cells and <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">involves complex cytokine cascades</span> (IL-17, IL-22, TNF-α), affecting the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">entire epidermis</span> and leading to neutrophil recruitment
>- Keratinocyte Response:
>	- Lichen Planus shows <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">normal to slow keratinocyte turnover</span>, allowing time for proper differentiation, resulting in <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">hypergranulosis (increased keratohyalin granules)</span>
>		- Because of immune stress?
>	- Psoriasis exhibits <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">extremely rapid keratinocyte turnover</span> (3-5 days vs normal 28-30 days), <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">preventing proper differentiation, leading to loss of granular layer and parakeratosis</span>
