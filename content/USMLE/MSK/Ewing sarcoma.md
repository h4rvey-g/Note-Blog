# Epidemiology
---
- Incidence: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">peak at 10â€“20 years</span>
	- Second most common primary bone tumor in children and adolescents, after osteosarcoma

# Etiology
---


# Pathophysiology
---


# Clinical features
---
- Localization
	- Primary tumor: often <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">diaphyses of long bones</span> (particularly femur, tibia, fibula, and humerus) and bones of the pelvis 
	- Metastasis: lungs, skeletal system, bone marrow
- Frequently first manifests with <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">localized pain</span> (progressive, worsens at night), hyperthermia, and swelling after trauma to the bone (tissue mass that is tender to palpation and accompanied by erythema)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">B symptoms are common.</span>

# Diagnostics
---
- Conventional X-ray
	- Lytic bone lesions
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Onion skin appearance of the periosteum</span> 
- Biopsy![[L67490.png|L67490.png]]
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Anaplastic small-blue-round-cell malignancy</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Tumor cells resemble lymphocytes.</span> 
		- Differential diagnoses include lymphoma and chronic osteomyelitis. 
	- Chromosomal translocation t(11;22)(q24;q12) which leads to expression of fusion protein EWS-FLI1
