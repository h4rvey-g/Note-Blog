# Epidemiology
- Poliovirus is still endemic in Afghanistan and Pakistan.

---
# Etiology
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Fecal-oral: absorption of poliovirus in the intestinal tract</span>
- Incubation time: 7-14 days

---
# Pathophysiology
The virus replicates in the gastrointestinal tract (oropharynx and small intestine) following oral ingestion → enters the bloodstream → potential invasion of the gray matter of the spinal cord (particularly the lower motor neurons of the anterior horn) → myelitis

---
# Clinical features
>[!tip] 
>Over 72% of infections with poliovirus are asymptomatic. Clinical infection (mostly flu-like symptoms) is observed in less than 24% of cases and less than 1% of infected individuals develop paralysis.

- Fever, malaise, headache, nausea
- Severe back, neck, and muscle pain
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Asymmetric acute flaccid paralysis worsens over hours to days</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Most commonly affects the leg muscles</span>
	- Paralysis is usually more severe in proximal muscles than in distal muscles.
	- Ascending paralysis with diaphragmatic involvement → respiratory failure

---
# Diagnostics
- Confirmatory test: PCR of CSF, stool, or oropharyngeal samples to test for poliovirus RNA 
- CSF will show:
	- High protein levels
	- Pleocytosis with either neutrophils (early infection) or lymphocytes (late infection)

---
# Differential Diagnosis
- Guillain-Barré syndrome: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Paralysis is typically symmetrical in Guillain-Barré syndrome. In addition, it would not manifest with CSF pleocytosis.</span>
- [[Acute intermittent porphyria|Acute intermittent porphyria]]: may also present with muscle weakness and bulbar paralysis
- Spinal muscular atrophy: Paralysis is typically symmetrical.

---
# Treatment
- Pain relief
- Airway management and mechanical [[ventilation|ventilation]] if needed

---
# Complications
- Post-polio syndrome (PPS) 
	- Most frequent complication observed following poliovirus infection (up to 40% of survivors)
	- Occurs decades after infection
	- Manifests with progressive muscle weakness and pain
