- Definition: an inherited, diffuse bone disease that results in sclerotic thickening of the skeleton on radiological examination
- Etiology: infancy or early childhood
- Pathophysiology: gene mutations → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">inability of [[Bone remodeling|osteoclasts]] to generate acidic environment in the bone matrix → bone resorption with preserved osteoblastic function → overgrowth of bone with pathological bone composition </span>
- Clinical features
	- Recurring pathological fractures (osteopetrotic bone tissue is very dense but brittle)
	- Cranial nerve disorders (e.g., palsies) due to hyperostosis and stenosis of the cranial nerve foramina
	- [[Pancytopenia|Pancytopenia]] due to reduced marrow space
	- Hepatosplenomegaly due to extramedullary hematopoiesis
- Diagnostics
	- X-ray: symmetrical, homogenous, sclerotic thickening of both cortical and trabecular bone (stone bone)![[Pasted image 20231020220814.png|Pasted image 20231020220814.png]]![[Pasted image 20231020220540.png|Pasted image 20231020220540.png]]
	- Calcium levels may be normal or low (especially in severe form, e.g., type I osteopetrosis).  
- Therapy
	- Bone marrow transplant (potentially curative treatment): Functional [[Bone remodeling|osteoclasts]] may develop from unimpaired monocytes deriving from transplanted stem cells.
