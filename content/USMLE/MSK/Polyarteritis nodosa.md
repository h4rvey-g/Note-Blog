# Definition
- Systemic [[Vasculitides|vasculitis]] of medium-sized vessels and small muscular arteries, leading to tissue ischemia
- Most commonly involves the skin, peripheral nerves, muscles, joints, gastrointestinal tract, and kidneys

---
# Epidemiology
- Peak incidence: 45–65 years of age
- Sex: ♂ > ♀

---
# Etiology
![[L64151.jpg|L64151.jpg]]
- A third of patients have underlying viral <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[hepatitis B|hepatitis B]] or [[hepatitis C|hepatitis C]].</span>
	- In these individuals, PAN is likely triggered by the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">deposition of immune complexes (viral antigen bound by host antibody) in the arterial wall.</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Transmural inflammation of the arterial wall with fibrinoid necrosis</span>

# Clinical features
- Nonspecific symptoms
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Fever, weight loss, malaise</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Muscle and joint pain</span>
- Organ involvement
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Renal involvement (∼ 60%): hypertension, renal impairment</span> 
	- Coronary artery involvement (∼ 35%); <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↑ risk of myocardial infarction</span>
	- Skin involvement (∼ 40%): rash, ulcerations, nodules
	- Neurological involvement: [[polyneuropathy|polyneuropathy]] (mononeuritis multiplex), <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">stroke</span>
	- GI involvement: abdominal pain, melena, nausea, vomiting
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Usually spares the lungs</span>

# Diagnostics
## Biopsy
- Transmural inflammation with <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">leukocytic infiltration and fibrinoid necrosis</span>
- Inflammatory lesions in various stages of development and regeneration![[07095126c92a07f8723a09833b4f643.jpg|07095126c92a07f8723a09833b4f643.jpg]]![[L28167.jpg|L28167.jpg]]![[L28169.jpg|L28169.jpg]]
## Visceral angiography
- Findings: most commonly seen in the renal, mesenteric, and hepatic artery branches (pulmonary arteries are usually not affected) 
	- Numerous microaneurysms (1–5 mm in diameter)![[Pasted image 20231010162421.png|Pasted image 20231010162421.png]]
	- Stenosis of small muscular arteries and medium-sized vessels
