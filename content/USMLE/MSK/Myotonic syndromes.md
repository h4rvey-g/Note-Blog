# Clinical features
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Myotonia: delayed muscle relaxation following normal muscle contraction</span>
	- Classically manifests as <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">difficulty releasing a handshake</span>
- Skeletal muscle weakness (due to muscle atrophy)
- Myalgia
- Arrhythmia 
- [[Cataract|Cataracts]]
- Testicular atrophy or features of ovarian insufficiency (i.e., infertility)
- Frontal balding
- Cognitive and behavioral impairment
## Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Gower maneuver</span>
	- The individual arrives at a standing position by supporting themselves on their thighs and then using the hands to “walk up” the body until they are upright. ![[Pasted image 20240402223808.png|Pasted image 20240402223808.png]]
	- Classic sign of DMD, but also occurs in inflammatory myopathies (e.g., [[Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies|dermatomyositis]], [[Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies|polymyositis]]) and other muscular dystrophies (e.g., BMD)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Calf pseudohypertrophy</span>
	- Mutations affecting the dystrophin gene→ alterations of dystrophin protein structure → partial (BMD) or almost complete (DMD) impairment of protein function → disturbance of numerous cellular signaling pathways → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">necrosis of affected muscle cells → replacement with connective tissue and fatty tissue → affected muscles are weak even though they appear larger</span> (“pseudohypertrophy”)
