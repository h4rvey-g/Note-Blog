| **Definition**                | A group of genetic disorders characterized by progressive muscle weakness and wasting. | Disorders characterized by muscle weakness along with myotonia (difficulty relaxing muscles after contraction). |
| **Main Types**                | Duchenne, Becker, Limb-Girdle, Facioscapulohumeral, etc.                               | Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1 (DM1) and Type 2 (DM2)                                                                |
| **Inheritance**               | Often X-linked (e.g., Duchenne/Becker) or autosomal (e.g., Limb-Girdle).               | Autosomal dominant.<br>[[Trinucleotide repeat expansion diseases|Trinucleotide repeat expansion diseases]]                                              |
| **Onset**                     | Usually in childhood or adolescence.                                                   | Typically adolescence or adulthood.                                                                             |
| **Primary Symptoms**          | Muscle weakness, wasting, contractures, scoliosis, cardiac complications.              | Muscle weakness, myotonia, cataracts, cardiac arrhythmias, endocrine issues.                                    |
| **Progression**               | Gradual; severity and speed depend on the subtype.                                     | Gradual; multisystem involvement often worsens with age.                                                        |
| **Pathophysiology**           | Defects in proteins like dystrophin (Duchenne/Becker) or other sarcolemmal proteins.   | Expanded CTG (DM1) or CCTG (DM2) repeats causing RNA toxicity and protein misregulation.                        |
| **Diagnosis**                 | Genetic testing, muscle biopsy, creatine kinase (CK) levels, EMG.                      | Genetic testing, EMG (shows myotonic discharges).                                                               |
| **Treatment**                 | Symptomatic: physical therapy, steroids (e.g., Duchenne), assistive devices.           | Symptomatic: medications for myotonia (e.g., mexiletine), physical therapy.                                     |
| **Cardiac Involvement**       | Common, especially in Duchenne and Becker (cardiomyopathy).                            | Common, often conduction abnormalities or arrhythmias.                                                          |
| **Respiratory Complications** | Can develop in advanced stages due to diaphragm involvement.                           | Can occur due to muscle weakness or central control issues.                                                     |
| **Cognitive Impact**          | Rare                                                                                   | Can include mild cognitive and behavioral changes.                                                              |
| **Prognosis**                 | Varies by type; some forms (e.g., Duchenne) are life-limiting.                         | Varies by severity; generally better than PMD but depends on systemic involvement.                              |
