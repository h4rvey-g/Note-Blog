- Definition: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">skin lesions caused by high fibroblast proliferation and collagen production as excessive tissue response to, typically small, skin injuries</span>
- Etiology: imbalance in wound healing processes due to local factors and genetics
- Pathophysiology
	- Increased synthesis and unorganized deposition of <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">collagen type I and collagen type III</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Increased TGF-Î² expression</span> and fibroblast proliferation
- Clinical features
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Brownish-red scar tissue of varying consistency (soft or hard) with claw-like appearance that grows beyond the boundaries of the original lesion </span>
	- Pruritus
	- Pain
	- Localization: earlobes, face (especially cheeks), upper extremities, chest, and neck 
- Diagnosis: based on clinical appearance of lesion and patient history of trauma or surgery
- Treatment: same as for hypertrophic scars (see above) 
	- Keloid scars recur after surgical excision in up to 100% of cases. A combined approach to treatment may have more success than surgery alone.
- Prognosis
	- Does not regress spontaneously
	- Frequent recurrences after resection
