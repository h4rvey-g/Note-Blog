- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Primary psoas abscess</span> 
	- Caused by hematogenous or lymphatic spread of a pathogen from a <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">distant source</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Secondary psoas abscess</span>
	- Caused by contiguous spread of a pathogen from an <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">adjacent infectious focus</span>
	- Primary focus may be:  
		- Gastrointestinal: e.g., IBD (especially [[Crohn disease|Crohn disease]]), colitis, appendicitis, diverticulitis, pancreatitis
		- Musculoskeletal: e.g., osteomyelitis (esp. of the vertebrae), Pott disease, paraspinal abscess, septic arthritis (commonly of the hip in children), prosthetic joint infection
		- Genitourinary: e.g., [[pyelonephritis|pyelonephritis]], cystitis
- Risk factors for psoas abscess 
	- Immunodeficiency (e.g., diabetes mellitus, HIV)
- Causative pathogens
	- [[Staphylococcus aureus|Staphylococcus aureus]]: Most common causative pathogen
