- Definition: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">an ulcerative lesion extending into the dermis that develops in the setting of bacteremia</span>
- Pathogen: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</span> (not pathognomonic but is the most common causative organism)
- Pathophysiology:
	- Classically develops in patients with P. aeruginosa bacteremia who are <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">immunocompromised</span>
	- Bacteria invade vasculature, causing septic vasculitis and cutaneous necrosis
	- Virulence factors destroy tissue:
		- Exotoxin A: inhibits elongation factor 2, impairing protein synthesis
		- Elastase: degrades elastin in blood vessel walls
		- Phospholipase C: breaks down cell membranes
- Clinical features
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Rapid progression (within 12–18 hours) of painless red macules → induration, development of pustules, vesicles, and/or bullae → crusted ulcers</span>![[highresdefault_L85806.png|highresdefault_L85806.png]]
