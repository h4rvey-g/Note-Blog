# Pathophysiology
---
<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Blockage of hair follicle → dilation and rupture → spilling of follicular contents into dermis</span> → inflammatory response → abscess formation and destruction of the pilosebaceous unit

# Clinical features
---
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Localized in intertriginous areas containing apocrine glands (most commonly the axillae, groin, inner thigh, perineal and perianal areas)</span>
- The first lesion is usually a <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">solitary painful inflammatory nodule</span> that progresses to an abscess that may open or regress spontaneously.
- Sinus tracts may form between multiple recurrent nodules and drain foul-smelling, seropurulent discharge.
- Development of open and closed comedones
- Scarring ranges from small, individual acneiform scars to thick scarred plaques that affect larger areas of skin.
