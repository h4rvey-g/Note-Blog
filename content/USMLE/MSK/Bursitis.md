- Because the bursa is not an intraarticular structure, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">bursitis typically does not interfere with joint range of motion (ie, there is normal, pain-free range of motion) unless it is significantly enlarged or inflamed.</span>
- In contrast, intraarticular pathologies (eg, septic arthritis, intraarticular fracture) that involve the capsule, synovium, or bone impair range of motion due to joint effusion and pain; diffuse joint swelling (not localized bursal swelling) is typically present
