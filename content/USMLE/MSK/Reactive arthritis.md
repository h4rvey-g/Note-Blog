# Clinical features

><span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">The clinical manifestations are caused by immune complexes involving bacterial antigens.  However, it does not represent disseminated infection, and joint aspirates are sterile (ie, it is a 'reactive' not infectious arthritis).</span>

		- Acute onset
		- Often asymmetrical with a migratory character
		- Occurs predominantly in the lower extremities 
	- Sacroiliitis
	- Enthesitis
	- Dactylitis
- Extra‑articular symptoms
