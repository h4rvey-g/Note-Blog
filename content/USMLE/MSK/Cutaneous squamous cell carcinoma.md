# Epidemiology
---


# Etiology
---
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Cumulative UV exposure</span> (from the sun or from tanning beds) is the most significant risk factor

# Pathophysiology
---


# Clinical features
---
- Precursor and early lesions
	- Precursor lesions ([[Precancerous skin lesions|actinic keratosis]]) and in situ lesions (Bowen disease) typically manifest as a <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">enlarging, rounded nodule with rough (keratinized) surface Â± ulceration, crusting and bleeding
	- Commonly on sun-exposed skin</span>![[Pasted image 20240412214818.png|Pasted image 20240412214818.png]]
- Invasive cSCC
	- Easy friability (i.e., <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">bleeds easily</span> after minor trauma)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Central ulceration</span>
	- Typically occurs on sun-exposed areas
- Metastatic cSCC
	- Most common sites for metastasis include lymph nodes (80%)

## Pathology
cSCC occurs as a result of <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">malignant transformation of keratinocytes in the [[Skin layers|stratum spinosum]] (prickle cell layer) of the epidermis.</span> These atypical keratinocytes appear as enlarged, polygonal cells with nuclear pleomorphism and atypical mitoses.
- Sheets or nests of <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">malignant keratinocytes</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Keratinization (eg, keratin pearls) & intercellular bridges</span>![[L80129.png|L80129.png]]

| Feature                | Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC)                                        | Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma (cSCC)                                                  |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Origin**             | Basal cells in the epidermis                                      | Squamous cells in the epidermis                                                           |
| **Common Locations**   | Sun-exposed areas: face, neck                                     | Sun-exposed areas: face, ears, neck, lips, back of the hands                              |
| **Appearance**         | Pearly or waxy bump, flat flesh-colored or brown scar-like lesion | Firm, red nodule, flat lesion with a scaly, crusted surface                               |
| **Growth Rate**        | Slow-growing                                                      | Can be faster-growing than BCC                                                            |
| **Risk of Metastasis** | Rare, low risk                                                    | Higher risk compared to BCC                                                               |
| **Common Causes**      | Chronic sun exposure, fair skin                                   | Chronic sun exposure, fair skin, history of burns or radiation exposure                   |
| **Typical Age Group**  | Older adults                                                      | Older adults                                                                              |
| **Prevalence**         | Most common type of skin cancer                                   | Second most common type of skin cancer                                                    |
| **Treatment Options**  | Surgical removal, topical medications, radiation therapy          | Surgical removal, topical medications, radiation therapy, chemotherapy for advanced cases |
| **Prognosis**          | Generally good if detected early                                  | Good if detected early; can be aggressive if untreated                                    |

- Nodular [[Basal cell carcinoma|BCC]] classically has a translucent or pearly appearance, often with central telangiectasias.![[L34111.png|L34111.png]]
- Cutaneous SCC classically has a rough or scaly (keratinized) surface![[L20488.png|L20488.png]]
