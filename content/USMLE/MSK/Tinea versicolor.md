- Pathogens
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Malassezia spp. (previously known as Pityrosporum): most commonly Malassezia globosa and Malassezia furfur</span>
	- Dimorphic, lipophilic yeast-like fungi that are part of normal skin flora
- Risk factors
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Warm and humid climates </span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Excessive sweating, seborrhea, and oily skin</span>
	- Immunosuppression
	- [[Cushing syndrome|Cushing syndrome]]

>[!tip] Malassezia yeast is not one of dermatophytes
>| Feature             | Malassezia Yeast                        | Dermatophytes                                                      |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Classification      | Genus of yeast                          | Group of fungi (genera: Trichophyton, Microsporum, Epidermophyton) |
| Habitat             | <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Normal skin flora</span>                       | Soil, animals, human-to-human transmission                         |
| Infections          | [[Tinea|Tinea]] versicolor, seborrheic dermatitis | Ringworm infections (e.g., [[Tinea|Tinea]] pedis, [[Tinea|Tinea]] corporis)            |
| Growth Requirements | Lipids (fats)                           | Keratinized tissues                                                |
| Pathogenicity       | Opportunistic under certain conditions  | Actively invade keratinized tissues                                |

# Pathophysiology
---
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Malassezia spp. infect the [[Skin layers|stratum corneum]] → lipid degradation → production of acids that inhibit tyrosinase and damage melanocytes → hypopigmentation</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Inflammatory response to pathogens → hyperpigmentation</span>

# Clinical features
---
- Round, well-demarcated macules that reveal a fine, subtle scale with gentle scraping that can coalesce into patches (which may have irregular shapes)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Colors vary (hypopigmented, hyperpigmented, or erythematous skin lesions) </span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Lesions do not tan in the sunlight, because of which they are more commonly noticed in the summer. </span>
- Milder pruritus (compared to dermatophyte infections)
- Common sites are the trunk and chest, but the neck, abdomen, upper arms, and thighs may also be affected.![[Pasted image 20240629212107.png|Pasted image 20240629212107.png]]
