| **Aspect**                    | **Progressive Muscular Dystrophies**                                                   | **[[Myotonic Syndromes|Myotonic Syndromes]]**                                                                                                               |

| **Definition**                | A group of genetic disorders characterized by progressive muscle weakness and wasting. | Disorders characterized by muscle weakness along with myotonia (difficulty relaxing muscles after contraction).                          |
| **Main Types**                | Duchenne, Becker                                                                       | Type 1 ([[Myotonic syndromes\|DM1]]) and Type 2 ([[Myotonic syndromes\|DM2]])                                                            |
| **Inheritance**               | Often X-linked (e.g., Duchenne/Becker) or autosomal (e.g., Limb-Girdle).               | Autosomal dominant.<br>[[Trinucleotide repeat expansion diseases|Trinucleotide repeat expansion diseases]]                                                                       |
| **Onset**                     | Usually in childhood or adolescence.                                                   | Typically adolescence or adulthood.                                                                                                      |
| **Primary Symptoms**          | Muscle weakness, wasting, contractures, scoliosis, cardiac complications.              | Muscle weakness, myotonia, [[Cataract\|cataracts]], cardiac arrhythmias, endocrine issues.                                               |
| **Progression**               | Gradual; severity and speed depend on the subtype.                                     | Gradual; multisystem involvement often worsens with age.                                                                                 |
| **Pathophysiology**           | Defects in proteins like dystrophin (Duchenne/Becker) or other sarcolemmal proteins.   | Expanded CTG ([[Myotonic syndromes\|DM1]]) or CCTG ([[Myotonic syndromes\|DM2]]) repeats causing RNA toxicity and protein misregulation. |
| **Diagnosis**                 | Genetic testing, muscle biopsy, creatine kinase (CK) levels, EMG.                      | Genetic testing, EMG (shows myotonic discharges).                                                                                        |
| **Treatment**                 | Symptomatic: physical therapy, steroids (e.g., Duchenne), assistive devices.           | Symptomatic: medications for myotonia (e.g., mexiletine), physical therapy.                                                              |
| **Cardiac Involvement**       | Common, especially in Duchenne and Becker (cardiomyopathy).                            | Common, often conduction abnormalities or arrhythmias.                                                                                   |
| **Respiratory Complications** | Can develop in advanced stages due to diaphragm involvement.                           | Can occur due to muscle weakness or central control issues.                                                                              |
| **Cognitive Impact**          | Rare                                                                                   | Can include mild cognitive and behavioral changes.                                                                                       |
| **Prognosis**                 | Varies by type; some forms (e.g., Duchenne) are life-limiting.                         | Varies by severity; generally better than PMD but depends on systemic involvement.                                                       |


# Epidemiology
---
- Sex: only male individuals affected in DMD and BMD 
- Age of onset
	- DMD: 2–5 years
	- BMD: adolescence or early adulthood, usually > 15 years

# Etiology
---
- Inheritance pattern (DMD and BMD): <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">X-linked recessive</span>
- Chromosomal mutations affecting the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">dystrophin gene</span> on the short arm of the X chromosome (Xp21)
	- DMD: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">frameshift deletion</span> or nonsense mutation → shortened or absent dystrophin protein
	- BMD: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">in-frame deletion</span> → partially functional dystrophin protein
	- In about two-thirds of DMD or BMD cases, deleted segments are as large as one or more exons.

# Pathophysiology
---
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Dystrophin protein: anchors the [[cytoskeleton|cytoskeleton]] of skeletal and cardiac muscle cells to the extracellular matrix by connecting cytoskeletal actin filaments to membrane-bound α- and β-dystroglycan, which are connected to extracellular laminin</span>![[Pasted image 20241130100905.png|Pasted image 20241130100905.png]]
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Dystrophin gene: largest known protein-coding gene in the human DNA</span>
	- Because of its size, the dystrophin gene is at increased risk for spontaneous mutations.
	- Mutations affecting the dystrophin gene→ alterations of dystrophin protein structure → partial (BMD) or almost complete (DMD) impairment of protein function → disturbance of numerous cellular signaling pathways → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">necrosis of affected muscle cells → replacement with connective tissue and fatty tissue → affected muscles are weak even though they appear larger (“pseudohypertrophy”)</span>
	- Errors in splicing in the DMD gene can also cause DMD.

# Clinical features
---
## Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Progressive muscle paresis and atrophy</span>
	- Starts in the proximal lower limbs (pelvic girdle)
	- Extends to the upper body and distal limbs as the disease progresses
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Weak reflexes</span>
- Waddling [[gait|gait]] (i.e., Duchenne limp) with bilateral [[Trendelenburg sign|Trendelenburg sign]]
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Gower maneuver</span>
	- The individual arrives at a standing position by supporting themselves on their thighs and then using the hands to “walk up” the body until they are upright. ![[Pasted image 20240402223808.png|Pasted image 20240402223808.png]]
	- Classic sign of DMD, but also occurs in inflammatory myopathies (e.g., [[Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies|dermatomyositis]], [[Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies|polymyositis]]) and other muscular dystrophies (e.g., BMD)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Calf pseudohypertrophy</span>
	- Mutations affecting the dystrophin gene→ alterations of dystrophin protein structure → partial (BMD) or almost complete (DMD) impairment of protein function → disturbance of numerous cellular signaling pathways → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">necrosis of affected muscle cells → replacement with connective tissue and fatty tissue → affected muscles are weak even though they appear larger</span> (“pseudohypertrophy”)
## Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) 
- Symptoms similar to those of DMD, but less severe
- Slower progression (patients often remain ambulatory into adult life)
