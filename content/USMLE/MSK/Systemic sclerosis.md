Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by vasculopathy and fibrosis of the skin and other organs.

## CREST syndrome
CREST syndrome refers to a constellation of symptoms traditionally associated with <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">limited SSc</span> (can also be seen in diffuse SSc).
- C: Calcinosis cutis: small white calcium deposits on the pressure points of the extremities (e.g., elbows, knees, fingertips) ![[Pasted image 20231010172910.png|Pasted image 20231010172910.png]]
- R: Raynaud phenomenon 
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">E: Esophageal hypomotility</span> (systemic sclerosis): <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">smooth muscle atrophy and fibrosis → esophageal dysmotility and decreased lower esophageal sphincter pressure → dysphagia, gastroesophageal reflux, heartburn → aspiration, Barrett esophagus, stricture</span>
- S: Sclerodactyly ![[Pasted image 20231010201149.png|Pasted image 20231010201149.png]]
- T: Telangiectasia![[Pasted image 20231010201224.png|Pasted image 20231010201224.png]]
## Cutaneous
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Thickening and hardening of the skin, which appears smooth, shiny, and puffy</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Sclerodactyly</span>: fibrotic thickening and tightening of the skin on the fingers and hands 
	- Edema followed by fibrosis that results in a waxy appearance of the skin
	- Limited range of motion and possibly flexure contractures and clawing of the digits
	- Multiple, painful ischemic digital ulcers with atrophy and necrotic spots
	- Digital pitting: hyperkeratotic scarring that most commonly affects the fingertips![[Pasted image 20231010201323.png|Pasted image 20231010201323.png]]
- Face changes
	- Loss of expression (mask-like facies) 
	- Smoothing of deep wrinkles
	- Microstomia (a disproportionately small mouth) accompanied by characteristic perioral wrinkles
## Renal
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Scleroderma renal crisis (SRC)</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Abrupt onset, life threatening</span>
	- SRC is caused by immune-mediated injury to <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">small renal vessels that typically spares the glomerular capillaries</span>
	- Clinical features of SRC
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Oliguric [[acute kidney injury|acute kidney injury]], proteinuria, hematuria</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hypertension with or without symptoms of hypertensive emergency</span>
		- Microangiopathic hemolytic [[anemia|anemia]] (<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">MAHA</span>) and thrombocytopenia
	- Treatment: ACE inhibitors
- [[Chronic kidney disease|Chronic kidney disease]]: reduced kidney function due to abnormal [[collagen|collagen]] deposition → thickening of renal arteriolar walls → decreased renal blood flow
## Pulmonary
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[Interstitial lung diseases|Interstitial lung disease]] </span>
- Pulmonary artery hypertension 
## Other extracutaneous
- Gastrointestinal tract
	- Esophageal dysmotility → dysphagia and reflux
	- Small bowel dysmotility → bloating, gas, constipation, and cramping 
- Vascular disease
	- Raynaud phenomenon 
	- Thromboembolism

# Diagnostics
>[!warning] 
><span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Scleroderma renal crisis is a medical emergency</span> with a high mortality rate. Promptly evaluate serum creatinine and urine protein in individuals with SSc who present with an acute rise in blood pressure and start management of SRC.
- Antinuclear antibodies (ANA): present in ∼ 90% of patients
- SSc-specific autoantibodies![[Pasted image 20240116151535.png|Pasted image 20240116151535.png]]

	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Anticentromere antibodies</span>: associated with limited SSc, increased risk for vascular complications (e.g., PAH)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Anti-SCl-70 (anti-topoisomerase I antibody)</span>: associated with severe and rapidly progressive diffuse SSc, limited SSc, ILD, digital ulcers
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Anti-RNA polymerase III</span>: associated with diffuse SSc, scleroderma renal crisis
