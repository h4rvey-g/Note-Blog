# Epidemiology

# Etiology
---
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[Atherosclerosis|Atherosclerosis]] in the aorta and peripheral arteries</span> → insufficient tissue perfusion → PAD
- PAD usually coexists with [[coronary artery disease|coronary artery disease]]. Smoking is one of the most important risk factors for PAD!

# Pathophysiology

# Clinical features
---
- Intermittent claudication
	- Femoropopliteal disease (most common): typically causes calf claudication 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Aortoiliac disease (Leriche syndrome)</span>
		- Level of the aortic bifurcation or bilateral occlusion of the iliac arteries
		- Triad of bilateral buttock, hip, or thigh claudication, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">erectile dysfunction</span>, and absent/diminished femoral pulses
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Worsens upon exertion</span>
		- Due to <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">increased oxygen demand</span>
