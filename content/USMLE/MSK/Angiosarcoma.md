- Etiology

	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Chronic [[Nonpitting edema|lymphedema]]: especially in postmastectomy lymph node resection</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Likely due to a combination of increased lymphatic proliferation, which increases the likelihood of malignant cells, and a decreased number of lymph nodes, which decreases the ability to remove the malignant cells.</span>
