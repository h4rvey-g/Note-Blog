# Etiology
## Diaper-related
### Irritant contact dermatitis (most common cause)
- Pathophysiology
	- Caused by<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)"> skin barrier breakdown</span> from exposure to urine and stool trapped within the diaper.  
	- Patients with frequent stooling (eg, diarrhea) are at increased risk because urease produced by fecal bacteria causes <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">an increase in local skin pH</span>, which allows for activation of proteolytic enzymes that disrupt the stratum corneum.  
	- Areas of macerated skin are then <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">prone to frictional damage</span> from the diaper, which further exacerbates the rash.
- Clinical features![[L38209.jpg|L38209.jpg]]
	- Acute: pruritic and/or painful erythema, edema, and vesicular rash
	- Chronic: pruritic and/or painful xerosis, scaling, lichenification, hyperkeratosis, and fissuring
	- Well-defined borders
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Does not have skinfold involvement or satellite lesions</span>
- Treatment
	- Thick <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">barrier ointment</span> (eg, petrolatum) or paste (eg, zinc oxide), which provides the skin an adherent layer of protection from contact with the stool and urine
### Allergic contact dermatitis
- Personal care products (e.g., perfumes, soaps, cosmetics)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Intensely pruritic</span> erythematous papules, vesicles with serous oozing
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Ill-defined borders</span>
### Candidiasis
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Scaly, erythematous, deep red plaques and satellite papules</span>![[L38210.jpg|L38210.jpg]]
