# Klinefelter syndrome
---
## Epidemiology
- One of the most common causes of <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">male [[hypogonadism|hypogonadism]]</span>

## Etiology
- Associated with advanced maternal age

## Pathophysiology
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">47,XXY</span> (rarely 48,XXXY or 48,XXYY)
	- Presence of a Barr body (inactivated X chromosome)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Testicular dysgenesis</span> leads to:
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Seminiferous tubules dysgenesis → loss of Sertoli cells → ↓ inhibin B → ↑ FSH</span>
	- Leydig cell dysfunction → ↓ testosterone → ↑ LH
- Both ↑ LH and ↑ FSH lead to <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">increased conversion of testosterone to estrogen.</span>

## Clinical features
![[Pasted image 20240207164358.png|Pasted image 20240207164358.png]]
- Eunuchoid growth pattern: tall, slim stature with long extremities (Growth plate closure is delayed )
- [[Gynecomastia|Gynecomastia]]
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Testicular atrophy</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Possible developmental delay</span>
	- Neurocognitive dysfunction (impaired executive function and memory, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">decreased intelligence</span>) 
- Associated disorders
	- [[Mitral valve prolapse|Mitral valve prolapse]]
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Increased risk of breast and [[Testicular tumors|testicular cancer]]</span>
		- Due to increased estrogen

# Turner syndrome
---
## Pathophysiology
 Chromosomal nondisjunction → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">chromosome X</span> monosomy/mosaicism → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">impaired ovarian development → malfunctioning streak gonads with connective tissue instead of normal germ cells → [[Androgen and estrogen synthesis|estrogen]] and progesterone deficiencies</span>
- Karyotype
	- Meiotic nondisjunction (most often in paternal gametes) → complete sex chromosomal monosomy (<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">45,XO</span>; no Barr body)
		- Barr body: The inactive X chromosome present in all female somatic cells. Appears as a small, dark-staining spot at the periphery of the nucleus. Consists of tightly-packed, transcriptionally-inactive, heterochromatin.
	- Mitotic nondisjunction of an embryonic cell → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">sex chromosomal mosaicism (45,XO/46,XX)</span> → mild phenotypic expression

## Clinical features
![[Pasted image 20240129204537.png|Pasted image 20240129204537.png]]
- Lymphatic system abnormalities
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Cystic hygroma</span>
		- a congenital lymphatic cyst (macrocystic lymphangioma) in the posterior triangle of the neck caused by malformation and <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">obstruction of the fetal lymphatic system</span>
		- Present at birth as a <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">soft, compressible, painless, posterior triangle neck mass </span>
		- Can cause dysphagia or airway compromise
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[Nonpitting edema|Lymphedema]] of the hands and feet in the neonatal period</span>
- Musculoskeletal findings
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Short stature</span>: due to the presence of only one copy of the SHOX (short stature homeobox) gene, normally located on the X chromosome 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Scoliosis are common</span>
	- Shield chest: broad chest with widely spaced nipples
	- Webbed neck: skin folds along the side of the neck between the mastoid process and the acromion 
	- Cubitus valgus
	- Short fourth metacarpals/metatarsals, nail dysplasia
	- High arched palate
	- Low-set posterior hairline
	- [[Osteoporosis|Osteoporosis]] and pathologic fractures 
- Cardiovascular abnormalities
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Bicuspid aortic valve: increased risk of premature [[Aortic valve stenosis|aortic stenosis]] and/or insufficiency </span>
		- As a result of valve calcification.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[Coarctation of the aorta|Coarctation of the aorta]]</span> with brachial-femoral delay

	- Hypertension (even in children) 
- Other disorders
	- Gonadoblastoma (especially in patients with 45,XO/46,XY mosaicism)

>Most patients with Turner syndrome have normal intelligence.

# Kallmann syndrome
---
## Etiology
[[Hypogonadism|Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism]] with hyposmia/anosmia

## Pathophysiology
- Defective migration of GnRH-releasing neurons from the olfactory bulbs to the hypothalamic preoptic nuclei → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↓ GnRH secretion</span> and underdevelopment of the olfactory bulbs
- ↓ GnRH → ↓ pituitary secretion of FSH and LH → ↓ testosterone in male individuals and ↓ estrogen in female individuals

## Clinical features
![[L18599.jpg|L18599.jpg]]
- Anosmia or hyposmia
- Infertility
