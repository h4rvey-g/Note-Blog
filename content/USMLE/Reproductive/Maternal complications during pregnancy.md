# Supine hypotensive syndrome
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Compression of the vena cava</span> and pelvic veins by the uterus may occur during the third trimester of [[pregnancy|pregnancy]] (typically >20 weeks) as a result of the mother <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">lying in a supine position</span>.
	- Gravid uterus → compression of the abdominal aorta and IVC → impaired venous return and decrease in cardiac output → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">placental hypoperfusion → fetal hypoxia → deceleration (CTG)</span>
	- After repositioning the mother in the left lateral position, the fetal heart rate recovers.
	- In the mother, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">supine hypotensive syndrome is characterized by tachycardia, dizziness, and nausea, and occasionally causes syncope.</span>
