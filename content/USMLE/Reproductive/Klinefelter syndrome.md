# Epidemiology
- One of the most common causes of <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">male [[hypogonadism|hypogonadism]]</span>

---
# Etiology
- Associated with advanced maternal age

---
# Pathophysiology
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">47,XXY</span> (rarely 48,XXXY or 48,XXYY)
	- Presence of a Barr body (inactivated X chromosome)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Testicular dysgenesis</span> leads to:
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Seminiferous tubules dysgenesis → loss of Sertoli cells → ↓ inhibin B → ↑ FSH</span>
	- Leydig cell dysfunction → ↓ testosterone → ↑ LH
- Both ↑ LH and ↑ FSH lead to <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">increased conversion of testosterone to estrogen.</span>
