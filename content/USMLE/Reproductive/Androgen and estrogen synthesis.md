# Androgen
- Four types of androgen: testosterone, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) are substrate in testosterone and estrogen synthesis</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Testosterone stimulates increased protein synthesis by skeletal myocytes. It has been misused and abused by athletes</span>, bodybuilders, weight lifters, and others to enhance athletic performance or physique
## Testosterone synthesis
<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Testosterone synthesis takes place in the testicles.</span>
- The [[hypothalamus|hypothalamus]] secretes gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) in pulses.
- GnRH stimulates the anterior pituitary cells to secrete luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH).
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">LH stimulates Leydig cells to produce testosterone.</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">FSH stimulates Sertoli cells to release:</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Androgen-binding protein, stimulating spermatogenesis</span>
	- Inhibin B: Serves as negative feedback control for FSH secretion, a marker of Sertoli cell function and of spermatogenesis.![[L10036.jpg|L10036.jpg]]
### Anabolic–androgenic steroids
- Definition: synthetic derivatives of testosterone
- Anabolic steroids are sometimes misused as performance-enhancing drugs by athletes.
- Side effects
	- [[Gynecomastia|Gynecomastia]]
	- Decreased testicular size
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Decreased sperm count, azoospermia</span>
		- Negative feedback that inhibits GnRH, which reduces FSH, causing less stimulus of spermatogenesis
	- Decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, infertility
	- Prostatic hypertrophy
## Adrenal androgen synthesis
Although the majority of testosterone is produced by the Leydig cells in the testicles, the adrenal cortex contributes to androgen production as well.![[Pasted image 20240130210737.png|Pasted image 20240130210737.png]]
- A stimulus triggers the secretion of CRH, leading to increased secretion of ACTH by the pituitary gland. 
- ACTH stimulates the conversion of cholesterol into pregnenolone in the adrenal cortex. 
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Enzymatic pathways trigger DHEA and androstenedione production in the zona reticularis.</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Androstenedione is converted into testosterone, which is then transformed into dihydrotestosterone via 5α-reductase.</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Aromatase converts testosterone into estradiol and androstenedione, which is then transformed into estrone.</span>
>[!Mnemonic] 
>Girls' body are more <font color="#ffc000">fragrant</font>...So <font color="#ffc000">aromatase</font> converts from andro- to estrogen.

>[!tip] 
>The testosterone and estrogen precursors DHEA and androstenedione are produced in the adrenal cortex in both male and female individuals. Testosterone is produced by Leydig cells in the testicles and, to a lesser degree, by the theca interstitial cells in the ovaries.
# Estrogen
---
## Ovarian estrogen synthesis
Estrogen synthesis <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">primarily takes place in the ovarian granulosa cells.</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">LH stimulates androgen synthesis in ovarian theca cells.</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">FSH stimulates conversion of androgens to estrogens.</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Conversion of androgens to estrogens is catalyzed by the aromatase enzyme.</span>
## Extra-ovarian estrogen synthesis
Estrogen is also produced in other aromatase-containing tissues:
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Fatty tissue</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Placenta</span>
- Testicles
- Adrenal glands
## Estrogen types
There are <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">three types of estrogen: estradiol, estrone, and estriol.</span>
- Potency: estradiol > estrone > estriol
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">During [[pregnancy|pregnancy]]</span>, estrogen concentration increases.
	- Estradiol and estrone: 100-fold increase
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Estriol: 1000-fold increase (it is secreted by the placenta as unconjugated estriol and a marker of fetal health)</span>
		- Fetal DHEA enters the maternal serum and is converted by the placenta to unconjugated estriol, which is then rapidly conjugated by the liver to a water-soluble form that can be excreted in urine.
## Estrogen effects
- Bones: ↑ bone formation by inhibiting bone resorption (induces osteoclast apoptosis)
	- A growth spurt occurs during early puberty primarily due to positive feedback by estrogen on growth hormone (GH) production.  GH stimulates insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) synthesis, which leads to the differentiation and proliferation of chondrocytes in the epiphyseal plate and therefore increased linear growth
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">At high doses, estradiol, a potent estrogen-derived steroid hormone, promotes senescence of chondrocytes and therefore closure of the epiphyseal plate (ie, growth plate). This relates to short stature in idiopathic precocious puberty</span>![[highresdefault_L88275.jpg|highresdefault_L88275.jpg]]
- Blood vessels: protective effect against [[atherosclerosis|atherosclerosis]]
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Blood clotting: ↑ risk of thrombosis</span>
- Kidneys: ↑ water and sodium retention (may contribute to edema)
- Protein synthesis
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Slightly ↑ (anabolic effect)</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↑ Transport proteins (e.g., SHBG, TBG)</span>
		- An increase in estrogen activity, as seen in pregnancy or postmenopausal estrogen replacement therapy, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">increases the level of thyroxine-binding globulin, causing a corresponding reduction in free T4 and T3 levels.</span>  In patients with a normal hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis, this reduction will result in a <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">transient increase in TSH, leading to increased thyroid hormone production until the additional TBG becomes saturated with thyroid hormone and free T4 and T3 levels are restored (ie, patients remain euthyroid).</span>  Therefore, an increase in the TBG level leads to an increase in total T4 and T3 (bound plus free fractions).![[L39742.jpg|L39742.jpg]]
