## Physiological gynecomastia
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Pubertal gynecomastia</span> 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Occurs in ∼ 50% of adolescent boys</span> (typically occurs in patients aged 10–14 years)
	- Caused by pubertal [[Androgen and estrogen synthesis|estrogen]]/[[Androgen and estrogen synthesis|androgen]] imbalance 
	- Clinical features
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Small, mobile, firm plaques of breast tissue in the subareolar region</span> that develop during puberty
		- Can be tender, unilateral/bilateral, and associated with fatty development around the nipple
		- Spontaneously resolves (usually by 17 years of age) 
## Pathological gynecomastia
### Drug-induced
| Drug                                                 | Mechanism                                                                                                             |

| **Estrogens**                                        | Direct stimulation of ductal epithelial hyperplasia                                                                   |
| **Antiandrogens** (e.g., flutamide, bicalutamide)    | Competitive inhibition of testosterone receptor                                                                       |
| **5-alpha reductase inhibitors** (e.g., finasteride) | ↓ Conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone                                                                   |
| **Spironolactone**                                   | <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↓ Testosterone synthesis & inhibition of testosterone receptor</span> |
| **Ketoconazole**                                     | ↓ Synthesis of steroid hormones (↓ androgen > ↓ estrogen)                                                             |
| **Cimetidine**                                       | Inhibition of testosterone receptor                                                                                   |
| **Androgen-anabolic steroids**                       | Aromatization of androgens to estrogen                                                                                |
