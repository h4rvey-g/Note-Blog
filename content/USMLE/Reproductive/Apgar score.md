- Used for standardized clinical assessment of newborns at <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">1 and 5 minutes</span> after birth
- Assessment of the Apgar score at 5 minutes: infants with <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">scores &lt; 7</span> may require further intervention
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Reassuring: 7–10</span>
	- Moderately abnormal: 4–6
	- Low: 0–3
