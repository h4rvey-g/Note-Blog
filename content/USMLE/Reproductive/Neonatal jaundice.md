## Breastfeeding jaundice
- Definition: a type of neonatal jaundice <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">caused by insufficient breastfeeding</span>
- Pathophysiology: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">insufficient breast milk intake  → lack of calories and inadequate quantities of bowel movements to remove bilirubin from the body</span> → ↑ enterohepatic circulation → increased reabsorption of bilirubin from the intestines → unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia 
- Clinical features: onset within 1 week
## Breast milk jaundice
- Definition: a type of neonatal jaundice caused by increased levels of β-glucuronidase in maternal breast milk
- Pathophysiology: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">increased concentration of β-glucuronidase in breast milk → ↑ deconjugation and reabsorption of bilirubin → persistence of physiologic jaundice with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">β-Glucuronidase is found in breast milk and the intestinal brush border.</span>
	- Deconjugation of bilirubin by bacterial β-glucuronidase can lead to pigment stone formation. 
- Clinical features: onset within 2 weeks after birth; lasts for 4–13 weeks 
- Treatment
	- Continued breastfeeding and supplementation with formula feeds 
	- Phototherapy, if required

## Kernicterus (chronic bilirubin encephalopathy) 
- Develops over first years of life
- Pathophysiology: deposition of unconjugated bilirubin (liposoluble) in the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">basal ganglia</span> and/or brain stem nuclei  
- Clinical features
	- Cerebral paresis, hearing impairment, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">vertical gaze palsy</span>
	- Movement disorder (choreoathetosis)
