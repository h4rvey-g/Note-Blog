## Risk factors
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">For contracting [[Human papillomavirus infection|HPV]] infection</span>
	- Actions that <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">increase the likelihood of [[Human papillomavirus infection|HPV]] infection (strongest risk factor)</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Multiple sexual partners </span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Lack of barrier contraceptive</span>
	- Early-onset of sexual activity
	- Multiparity
	- Immunosuppression (e.g., [[Human immunodeficiency virus|HIV]] infection, post-transplantation)
- Environmental risk factors
	- Cigarette smoking and/or exposure to second-hand smoke (for squamous cell cancer types only) 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">In-utero exposure to diethylstilbestrol (DES)</span>

# Pathophysiology
## Overview of terminology
![[Pasted image 20240827142818.png|Pasted image 20240827142818.png]]
### Two-tiered terminology (Bethesda system)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">High-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL)</span>
	- Lesions with moderate to severe epithelial dysplasia that are most likely associated with persistent HPV infection
	- HSIL lesions can progress to invasive cervical cancer (precancerous lesion).
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL)</span>
	- Lesions with mild epithelial dysplasia that are typically associated with transient HPV infections
	- Correlates with CIN1
### Three-tiered terminology 
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)</span> is characterized by epithelial dysplasia that <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">begins at the basal layer of the squamocolumnar junction and extends outward.</span>
- Based on the degree of dysplasia, lesions are classified as CIN1 (mild), CIN2 (moderate), or CIN3 (severe).
### Current standard
The current standard for reporting cervical histopathology and cytopathology to ensure optimal management is a combination of the two-tier and three-tier system (i.e., the two-tiered nomenclature with an additional qualifier using the intraepithelial neoplasia nomenclature).
- LSIL correlates with CIN1.
- HSIL correlates with CIN3 and CIN2.
- HSIL should be specified as HSIL (CIN2), HSIL (CIN3), or HSIL unspecified.

## Normal cervix
1. Endocervix: inner part of the cervix proximal to the uterine external os
	- Composed of simple columnar epithelium with mucous-producing cells
2. Cervical transformation zone: physiologic transition zone between the endocervix and ectocervix
	- Exact location is variable
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Site of the squamocolumnar junction: the border between metaplastic squamous epithelium and simple columnar epithelium</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Cervical cancer most commonly occurs in this zone.</span>
3. Ectocervix: outer part of the cervix distal to the uterine external os
	- Composed of stratified squamous epithelium (nonkeratinized)

# Pathology
- Invasive cervical carcinoma is characterized by invasion of the tumor beyond the basement membrane of the cervical epithelium.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">HSIL and invasive cervical carcinoma most commonly arise from metaplastic squamous cell epithelium in the cervical transformation zone</span>
## Squamous cell carcinoma (âˆ¼ 80% of cases)
- Subtypes include large cell keratinizing, large cell nonkeratinizing, and papillary squamous cell carcinoma.
- Irregular cell morphology
- Hyperchromatic cells with nonspherical nuclei, mitotic activity, and prominent nucleoli
- Loss of basal membrane
