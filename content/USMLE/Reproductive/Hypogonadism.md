## Hypergonadotropic hypogonadism (primary hypogonadism)
Hypergonadotropic hypogonadism is caused by <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">insufficient sex steroid production in the gonads.</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Primary gonadal insufficiency: [[Turner syndrome|Turner syndrome]] (females), [[Klinefelter syndrome|Klinefelter syndrome]] (males)</span>, anorchia
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Secondary gonadal insufficiency (damage to [[Androgen and estrogen synthesis|Leydig cells]] or ovarian tissue)</span>: chemotherapy, pelvic irradiation, trauma/surgery, autoimmune disease (e.g, autoimmune polyglandular syndrome), infections (e.g., [[mumps|mumps]], [[tuberculosis|tuberculosis]])
## Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (secondary hypogonadism)
Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is caused by an <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">insufficient gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and/or gonadotropin release at the hypothalamic-pituitary axis.</span>
- Genetic disorders
	- [[Kallmann syndrome|Kallmann syndrome]]
	- Idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH): a genetic disorder characterized by a defect in GnRH production/action in the absence of anosmia
	- Prader-Willi syndrome
	- [[Lysosomal Storage Diseases|Gaucher disease]]
- Hypothalamic and/or pituitary lesions
	- Neoplasm (e.g. [[Pituitary adenoma|prolactinoma]], craniopharyngioma, astrocytoma)
	- Trauma, surgery, irradiation
# Pathophysiology
---
Diminished functional activity of the gonads → reduced biosynthesis of sex hormones → impaired secondary sexual characteristics and infertility
- Hypergonadotropic hypogonadism: gonadal insufficiency → insufficient sex steroid production (↓ testosterone, ↓ estrogen) → increased gonadotropin secretion (↑ FSH and ↑ LH) from the anterior pituitary → lack of negative feedback from the impaired gonads → further ↑ FSH and ↑ LH levels
- Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism
	- In [[Kallmann syndrome|Kallmann syndrome]]: impaired migration of GnRH cells and defective olfactory bulb → ↓ GnRH in [[hypothalamus|hypothalamus]] → ↓ FSH and ↓ LH → ↓ testosterone and ↓ estrogen
	- In hypothalamic and/or pituitary lesions: ↓ pituitary gonadotropins (↓ FSH and ↓ LH) → ↓ testosterone and ↓ estrogen

- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hypergonadotropic hypogonadism: ↑ GnRH, ↑ LH/FSH</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism: ↓ GnRH, ↓ LH/FSH</span>

>[!tip] 
>- Normally LH/FSH = 1
>- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">LH is more sensitive to hypothalamic GnRH</span>
