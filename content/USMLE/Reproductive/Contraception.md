# Hormonal contraception

## Mechanism of action for hormonal contraceptives
- [[Androgen and estrogen synthesis|Estrogen]]: suppresses release of GnRH from the [[hypothalamus|hypothalamus]] → ↓ release of pituitary gonadotropins (FSH, LH)
	- Decreased FSH → prevents ovarian folliculogenesis 
	- Decreased LH → inhibition of ovulation 
- Progestin: synthetic progesterone → 
	- Inhibits GnRH and LH secretion → suppressed ovulation (main contraceptive mechanism) 
	- Inhibits endometrial proliferation → decreases chance of embryo implantation 
	- Changes cervical mucus (↓ volume and ↑ viscosity) and impairs fallopian tube peristalsis → inhibits sperm migration and embryo implantation 
## Contraindications

	- Tobacco use
	- Prolonged immobilization
	- Prior venous thromboembolism
	- Thrombophilia (eg, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome) <3 weeks postpartum
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↑ Cardiovascular disease & stroke</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[Migraine|Migraines]] with aura</span>
	- Uncontrolled [[hypertension|hypertension]]
	- [[Coronary artery disease|Ischemic heart disease]]
	- Prior stroke
- Medical conditions negatively affected by ↑ estrogen
	- Active [[breast cancer|breast cancer]]
	- Active liver disease (eg, acute hepatitis, liver cancer)
