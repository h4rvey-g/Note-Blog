# Physiological changes during pregnancy
---
## Respiratory system
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↑ Oxygen consumption</span> (by approx. 20%)
- ↑ Intraabdominal pressure through uterine growth → dyspnea (the diaphragm is displaced upwards → ↓ total lung capacity, residual volume, functional residual capacity, and expiratory reserve volume)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Progesterone stimulates the respiratory centers in the brain → hyperventilation (to eliminate fetal CO2 more efficiently) → physiological, chronic compensated respiratory alkalosis</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[Ventilation|Ventilation]] is increased primarily ↑ Tidal volume → ↑ minute [[ventilation|ventilation]]</span>
		- Elevated progesterone levels trigger a sensation of shortness of breath and stimulate the [[hypothalamus|hypothalamus]] to increase respiratory drive.
		- Facilitated by increased diaphragmatic excursion and hormone-induced laxity of the intercostal muscles that allows for enlargement of the thoracic cavity (although the expanding uterus displaces the resting position of the diaphragm upward, diaphragmatic excursion is not impaired).
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↓ PCO2 (∼ 30 mm Hg)</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Slight</span> increase in respiratory rate
## Renal system
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↑ Renal plasma flow → ↑ GFR</span> → ↓ BUN and creatinine
	- Increased cardiac output leads to increased renal perfusion.
	- Therefore, serum creatinine levels considered normal in nonpregnant patients (eg, 1.0 mg/dL) represent significant renal dysfunction in this population.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↑ Glucose levels in urine: Increased glomerular filtration results in overload of the glucose carrier responsible for its resorption.</span>
## Hematologic system
- ↑ Plasma volume → ↓ hematocrit, especially towards the end of pregnancy (30–34th week of gestation) → dilutional anemia (hemoglobin value rarely drops below 11 g/dL)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hypercoagulability is due to an increase in fibrinogen, factor VII, and factor VIII and a decrease in protein S (reduces the risk of intrapartum blood loss).</span>
	- Increased [[Androgen and estrogen synthesis|estrogen]] and progesterone levels
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↓ Platelet count → gestational thrombocytopenia</span>
- ↑ RBC mass (increases from 8–10th week of gestation until the end of pregnancy) 
- ↓ Iron and folate levels due to increased vitamin and mineral requirements
## Endocrine system
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Human placental lactogen (hPL)</span>: a hormone synthesized by syncytiotrophoblasts of the placenta, which <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">promotes the production of insulin.</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Increased maternal glucose levels</span>: allows glucose to freely cross the placenta for <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">consumption by the fetus for energy</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Causes insulin resistance</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Increased maternal proteolysis: provides a readily available supply of amino acids for the fetus</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Increased maternal lipolysis</span>: leads to increased free fatty acids and ketones <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">to provide energy to the mother, preserving glucose and amino acids for the fetus</span>
