# Physiological changes during pregnancy
## Renal system
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↑ Renal plasma flow → ↑ GFR</span> → ↓ BUN and creatinine
	- Increased cardiac output leads to increased renal perfusion.
	- Therefore, serum creatinine levels considered normal in nonpregnant patients (eg, 1.0 mg/dL) represent significant renal dysfunction in this population.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↑ Glucose levels in urine: Increased glomerular filtration results in overload of the glucose carrier responsible for its resorption.</span>
