# Definition
---
- Preeclampsia: new-onset gestational hypertension with proteinuria or end-organ dysfunction 
	- Superimposed preeclampsia: preeclampsia that occurs in a patient with chronic hypertension
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">HELLP syndrome</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">A life-threatening form of preeclampsia characterized by Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes, and Low Platelets</span>
		- May occur without hypertension or proteinuria 
	- Occurrence of new-onset hypertension, proteinuria, or end-organ dysfunction at < 20 weeks' gestation is suggestive of gestational trophoblastic disease.
- Eclampsia: new-onset seizures (tonic-clonic, focal, or multifocal) in the absence of other causes ; a convulsive manifestation of hypertensive pregnancy disorders

# Diagnostics
## Urine studies
In the kidneys, vasospasm causes decreased renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate, leading to <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">minimal, concentrated urine (ie, high specific gravity) and increased serum creatinine levels.</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">24-hour urine collection (gold standard): proteinuria (urinary protein excretion ≥ 300 mg/day) </span>
- Urine protein:creatinine ratio: ≥ 0.3 
- Urine dipstick: > 2+ protein

# Treatment
## Antihypertensives in pregnancy
### Antihypertensives for urgent blood pressure control in pregnancy 
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Parenteral labetalol (avoid in patients with contraindications to β-blockers) </span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Nifedipine (immediate release)</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Parenteral hydralazine</span>
### Common oral antihypertensives in pregnancy 
- Labetalol
- Nifedipine (extended release)
- Methyldopa
## <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Magnesium sulfate for seizure prophylaxis</span>
- Indications
	- Eclampsia 
	- HELLP syndrome
	- Preeclampsia with severe features
- Administration: magnesium sulfate (IV or IM)
	- Contraindicated in patients with [[myasthenia gravis|myasthenia gravis]] 
	- Should be administered with care in patients with renal insufficiency 
- Monitoring
	- Monitor all patients for signs of hypermagnesemia (e.g., decreased deep tendon reflexes, respiratory depression).
	- Signs of hypermagnesemia: Administer calcium gluconate (see “Hypermagnesemia” for clinical features and more information on management of hypermagnesemia).
## Aspirin for preeclampsia prophylaxis
- Indications
	- ≥ 1 high-risk feature or ≥ 2 moderate-risk factors for preeclampsia.
- Regimen
	- Initiate low-dose aspirin between 12–20 weeks' gestation (optimally before 16 weeks)
