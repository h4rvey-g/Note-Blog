<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">A genetic syndrome caused by a G-protein activating mutation</span> and subsequent continuous stimulation of endocrine functions
# Epidemiology
---


# Etiology
---
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Mosaic mutation in the GNAS1 gene</span> on chromosome 20 (autosomal recessive inheritance)
	- Some cells have a normal version of the GNAS1 gene, while other cells have the mutated version. 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Embryos only survive if mosaicism occurs.</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">If the mutation occurs before fertilization, it affects all cells → incompatible with life.</span>

# Pathophysiology
---
Activating mutation in GNAS gene → impaired Gs-protein signaling → constitutively activated adenylate cyclase → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">excess production of cAMP</span>

# Clinical features
---
Triad of:
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Unilateral café-au-lait spots with unilateral, ragged edges  </span>
	- These hyperpigmented macules can also be seen in individuals with [[Neurocutaneous disorders|neurofibromatosis]]. However, in the case of [[Neurocutaneous disorders|neurofibromatosis]], they have smooth borders (“coast of California” appearance), those associated with fibrous dysplasia have rough, serpiginous borders (“coast of Maine” appearance).![[Pasted image 20240328104109.png|Pasted image 20240328104109.png]]
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia</span>, usually occur on one side of the body
- Endocrinopathies
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Peripheral precocious puberty (most common)</span>

# Diagnostics
---
- X-rays of long bones: well-defined, lobulated lesions with a thin cortex and a radiolucent, ground-glass appearance![[Pasted image 20240328104711.png|Pasted image 20240328104711.png]]
