## Noncommunicating hydrocephalus (obstructive hydrocephalus)
Obstruction of the cerebral aqueduct of Sylvius, the lateral foramen of Luschka, or the median foramen of Magendie results in obstructed passage of CSF from the ventricles to the subarachnoidal space.
- Congenital: Noncommunicating hydrocephalus is the most common form of congenital hydrocephalus.

		- Causes a variety of neurologic abnormalities (e.g., ataxic [[gait|gait]]) and noncommunicating hydrocephalus
		- Associated with a variety of extracranial abnormalities (e.g., craniofacial abnormalities, cardiac defects, spina bifida)
	- Intrauterine infections: e.g., congenital toxoplasmosis (see [[Congenital TORCH infections|Congenital TORCH infections]])
	- Colloid cyst obstructing the interventricular foramen
	- Congenital stenosis of the cerebral aqueduct of Sylvius
