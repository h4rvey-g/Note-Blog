Maternal colonization with group B streptococcus (GBS) is the most significant risk factor for early-onset neonatal GBS infections.
# Prenatal screening for GBS
## Indications
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Routine screening for all women from 36+0 to 37+6 weeks' gestation, regardless of planned delivery method</span>
	- in order to guide management if unexpected early labor or rupture of membranes occurs.
## Method of collection
<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Swab the lower vagina and introitus, followed by the rectum.</span>
# Prophylaxis for neonatal GBS infection
## Indications for GBS prophylaxis
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">History of early-onset GBS infection in a previous newborn</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Documented GBS colonization during the current pregnancy</span>, i.e.:
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Positive GBS culture</span>
	- GBS bacteriuria 
- Unknown GBS status in current pregnancy PLUS any of the following are present:
	- Any maternal risk factors for neonatal early-onset GBS infection
		- Imminent preterm delivery < 37+0 weeks' gestation or PPROM
		- Prolonged rupture of membranes (i.e., > 18 hours)
		- Maternal temperature ≥ 100.4 °F (38.0 °C)
	- Positive intrapartum NAAT 
	- Positive GBS status confirmed via culture or bacteriuria in a previous pregnancy

>[!tip] 
>Regardless of GBS culture results, intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis for neonatal GBS is not needed if cesarean delivery is performed prior to the onset of labor and with intact membranes.

## Antibiotic regimens
Antibiotics should ideally be initiated at least 4 hours prior to delivery.
- No penicillin reaction: IV β-lactam antibiotics, i.e., IV penicillin G (off-label) OR IV ampicillin (off-label)
