# Epidemiology
---


# Etiology
---
## Type I endometrial cancer
- Directly related to long-term exposure to increased estrogen levels
- Some genetic mutations (e.g., in the PTEN gene or mismatch repair genes) are also associated with this type of cancer.
## Type II endometrial cancer
- Mostly estrogen-independent
- Associated with endometrial atrophy (especially in postmenopausal women)
- Strongly associated with a genetic predisposition 
## Risk factors for estrogen-dependent tumors 
- Nulliparity
- Early menarche and late menopause
- Polycystic ovary syndrome
- Metabolic syndrome (esp. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">obesity and diabetes mellitus type 2</span>)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Fat cells contain the enzyme aromatase and produce extra-ovarian estrogen, while anabolic insulin stimulates the production of extra-ovarian estrogen and also the proliferation of endometrial cells via IGF-1.</span>
- Hypertension
- Unopposed estrogen replacement therapy  (e.g., for menopausal symptoms)
- History of breast cancer and tamoxifen treatment
- Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer)
