# Epidemiology
- Prevalence: most common congenital gastrointestinal tract anomaly

---
# Etiology
- The omphalomesenteric duct (vitelline or vitellointestinal) is a patent tubular structure connecting the yolk sac to the alimentary tract in the embryo.
- The duct is normally obliterated by the 6–7th week of intrauterine life.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Incomplete obliteration of the omphalomesenteric duct → persistence of the proximal (intestinal) segment of the duct → Meckel diverticulum</span>![[Pasted image 20231213092649.png|Pasted image 20231213092649.png]]![[Pasted image 20231213092707.png|Pasted image 20231213092707.png]]
- There may be two types of mucosal lining
	- Native ileal mucosa
	- Ectopic mucosa
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Most common: acid-producing gastric mucosa</span> (∼ 60%)
		- Other types include pancreatic, colonic, and duodenal mucosa.

# Pathophysiology

# Clinical features
- Asymptomatic
	- Most common manifestation
- Symptomatic
	- Lower gastrointestinal bleeding (most common feature)
		- Presence of <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">ectopic gastric mucosa</span> or pancreatic tissue → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">acid or enzyme secretion within the diverticulum → ileal ulceration → bleeding</span>
		- Can manifest as:
			- Hematochezia 
				- Indicates a brisk hemorrhage
			- Tarry stools 
				- Indicate a slow hemorrhage
			- Currant jelly stools
				- Indicate intussusception with bowel ischemia

# Diagnostics
<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Meckel scintigraphy scan (Meckel scan)</span>: a noninvasive nuclear medicine imaging technique using <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">radiolabelled technetium (<sup>99m</sup>Tc), which is preferentially absorbed by the gastric mucosa and can identify ectopic gastric mucosa</span>![[Pasted image 20240303100534.png|Pasted image 20240303100534.png]]
