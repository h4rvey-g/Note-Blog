# Abnormalities of morphogenesis
---
- Agenesis: Absent organ due to absent primordial tissue.
- Aplasia: Absent organ despite presence of primordial tissue.
- Association: a collection of malformations that are often seen together and do not have a known, common cause 
- Hypoplasia: Incomplete organ development; primordial tissue present.
- Disruption: 2° breakdown of tissue with normal developmental potential (eg, amniotic band syndrome).
- Deformation: Extrinsic mechanical distortion (eg, congenital torticollis); occurs during fetal period.
- Malformation: Intrinsic developmental defect (eg, cleft lip/palate); occurs during embryonic period.
	- Arteriovenous malformation (an abnormal, high-flow connection between arteries and veins bypassing capillaries which develops due to disrupted angiogenesis)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Sequence: Abnormalities result from a single 1° embryologic event (eg, oligohydramnios → Potter sequence).</span>
- Field defect: Disturbance of tissues that develop in a contiguous physical space (eg, [[holoprosencephaly|holoprosencephaly]]).
