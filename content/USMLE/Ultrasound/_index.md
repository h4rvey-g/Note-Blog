# Hyperechoic and hypoechoic
- Hypoechoic masses are solid masses of dense tissue that appear dark gray on the ultrasound image. They can be cancerous.Â 
- Hyperechoic masses bounce back many sound waves and appear as light gray on the ultrasound. They are not as dense as hypoechoic masses and may contain air, stone, bone, fat, or fluid. Hyperechoic masses are rarely cancerous.
