## BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen)
The basic metabolic panel also assesses renal function, which includes a BUN and creatinine. 
The normal range for BUN is about 5-20 mg/dL.

The Trick:
Use the word “bun” to think of [[Hallux valgus|bunion]]. 
Bunions are typically located on the toes or digits, and we have 5 digits per extremity which totals 20 digits. 
This will help you remember the normal range for BUN is 5-20 mg/dL.

## Calcium
Calcium is another electrolyte measured in a BMP. 
The normal range for calcium is 8.5-10.5 mg/dL.

The Trick:
When you think of calcium, think of milk.
A gallon of milk weighs about 8.5 pounds. 
Then think of 2% milk to help you remember to add 2 to the 8.5. 
This will give you the normal range for calcium of 8.5-10.5 mg/dL.

## Glucose
A BMP also measures glucose. 
A normal glucose level is 70-100 mg/dL.

The Trick:
When you think of glucose, think of energy.
Our energy starts to decline during our elderly years, especially when we are 70-100 years old.
This will help you remember the normal range for glucose is 70-100 [[Myasthenia gravis|mg]]/dL.
