The axon is damaged but the perineurium and epineurium remain intact.![[../img/Pasted image 20240203103631.png|Pasted image 20240203103631.png]]
# Leads to central chromatolysis 
- Definition: the reaction of a neuronal cell body in response to an axonal injury
- Function: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">increase in protein synthesis to help restore the integrity of the damaged axon</span>
- Characteristics
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Swelling of the neuronal body</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Dispersion of the Nissl bodies</span> (which gives the name chromatolysis (chroma: color; lysis: disintegration))
		- The rough endoplasmatic reticulum of neurons.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Displacement of the nucleus to the periphery</span>
# Results in Wallerian degeneration
- Definition: an active neuronal degeneration process in response to axonal injury
- Function
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">To clear axonal debris and prevent scarring</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Facilitate targeted reinnervation and functional recovery of tissues previously innervated by that axon before injury</span>
- Characteristics![[../img/Pasted image 20240522220202.png|Pasted image 20240522220202.png]]
	- Initially retained electrical excitability of axonal membrane distal to the injury, lasting up to 36 hours
	- Progressive degeneration of distal segment [[./Cytoskeleton|cytoskeleton]] with dissolution of axonal membrane
	- Degradation of residual myelin sheath by macrophages and Schwann cells
		- In the central nervous system, phagocytic macrophages/microglia are recruited more slowly because of the blood-brain barrier. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">This slows removal of the myelin debris, which can persist for years in the degenerating tracts and suppress axonal growth via myelin-associated inhibitory factors.</span>
	- The proximal stump either stays in place or retracts slightly
	- Ultimately, the cell body will sprout regenerative nerve fibers that, ideally, reinnervate the distal tissues.
	- Regeneration is significantly more efficient in the peripheral nervous system than in the central nervous system.
	- Good chance of at least partial recovery
