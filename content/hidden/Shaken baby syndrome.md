Definition: head trauma through strong rotational and shearing force
# Epidemiology
high mortality and a significant cause of death

---
# Etiology
violent shaking of a child

---
# Pathophysiology
- Rotational and shearing forces → shearing off of bridging veins → subdural hematoma
- Shaking of the child with a weak neck support → respiratory problems and apnea → hypoxia → brain edema and ischemia → diffuse axonal damage![[../img/Pasted image 20231002103937.png|Pasted image 20231002103937.png]]

# Clinical features
- Inconsistent or implausible history from caretakers
- Injuries are hardly evident or entirely absent on physical exam.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Retinal hemorrhages</span>
- Irritability or lethargy
- Seizures
- Vomiting
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Tense fontanelle</span>
- Rib fractures

---
# Diagnostics
- Non-contrast CT
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Subdural hematomas and/or [[./Intracranial hemorrhage|subarachnoid hemorrhage]]</span> of varying ages
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Reversal sign: diffuse blurring of the grey-white matter interface</span>
	- Diffuse punctate hemorrhages

---
# Treatment
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Always notify Child Protective Services. </span>
	- Medical practitioners are obligated to report child abuse even if that means breaking patient-physician confidentiality.
	- Reasonable suspicion is sufficient;<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)"> confirmation of abuse or neglect is not required</span> for reporting purposes.
- Interview child and parent/caregiver separately if possible.
- Keep verbatim record.
