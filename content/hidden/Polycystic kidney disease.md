It is classified into two distinct disorders: autosomal recessive PKD (ARPKD) and autosomal dominant PKD (ADPKD).
# Epidemiology
ADPKD: The most common inherited cause of [[./Chronic kidney disease|chronic kidney disease]]

---
# Etiology
- ADPKD
	- PKD1 on chromosome 16 (85% of cases)
	- PKD2 on chromosome 4 (15% of cases)
 - ARPKD
	 - Mutation in PKHD1 gene on chromosome 6

# Pathophysiology
formation and expansion of cysts in the renal cortex and medulla → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">compression of renal vessels with activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), ischemia, and destruction of the kidney parenchyma</span>

---
# Clinical features
## ADPKD
- Symptom onset: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">occur after 30 years of age</span>, but the disease may also manifest during childhood.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Cysts develop over many years</span>.
- Renal manifestations
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Gross hematuria</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Flank or abdominal pain</span>
		- The pain is often dull and persistent and is thought to be caused by stretching of the wall of a cyst or pressure on other organs when the kidneys and/or liver are very large.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Recurrent [[./Urinary tract infections|urinary tract infections]]</span>
	- [[./Nephrolithiasis|Nephrolithiasis]]
	- Kidneys might be palpable and enlarged on abdominal exam (they are usually normal at birth)
	- Signs of [[./Chronic kidney disease|chronic kidney disease]] (e.g., hypertension, fluid overload, uremia)
 - Extrarenal manifestations
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Multiple benign hepatic cysts</span> (prevalence increases with age)
	- Cysts may also occur in the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">pancreas</span>, spleen, ovary, and testicles. 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Cerebral berry aneurysm</span> (∼8%)
		- The risk is higher in patients with a family history positive of ADPKD.
		- May rupture and cause [[./Intracranial hemorrhage|subarachnoid hemorrhage]] (the risk for growth and rupture is the same in patients with ADPKD as in the general population)
- Cardiovascular 
	- Signs of <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">arterial hypertension</span> (e.g., morning [[./Headaches|headaches]]) through increased renin production
	- Heart valve defects (particularly <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[./Mitral valve prolapse|mitral valve prolapse]]</span>)
- Colon [[./Diverticulosis|diverticula]] ([[./Diverticulosis|diverticulosis]])
## ARPKD
- Symptom onset: Symptoms most commonly manifest <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">in infancy or childhood</span>.
- Renal manifestations
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Protruding abdomen (nontender abdominal mass)</span> due to bilateral renal enlargement and/or [[./Hepatomegaly|hepatomegaly]]
	- Chronic renal failure: frequently hematuria, proteinuria, and oliguria
	- Severe in-utero renal impairment → oliguria in utero → maternal [[./Oligohydramnios|oligohydramnios]] → [[./Potter sequence|Potter sequence]]
 - Extrarenal manifestation
	- Hypertension
		- Possibly related to the activation of RAAS and enhanced sodium retention.
	- Liver involvement: congenital hepatic and portal fibrosis → progressive liver failure and portal hypertension

# Diagnostics
- ADPKD
	- In adults: enlarged kidneys with multiple cysts bilaterally of <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">varying sizes </span>(anechoic masses)
- ARPKD
	- Enlarged kidneys with multiple cysts bilaterally of <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">equal size</span>
