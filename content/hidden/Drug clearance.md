# <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Renal elimination: mostly hydrophilic drugs</span>
- Main renal elimination mechanisms include
	- Glomerular filtration 
	- Tubular secretion 
	- Tubular reabsorption 
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Ionized substances cannot cross renal tubular membranes and are cleared quickly.</span>
	- Weak acidic drugs (e.g., phenobarbital, methotrexate, aspirin) are trapped in a basic environment
		- Overdoses with these drugs can be treated via alkalinization of urine (sodium bicarbonate)
		- RCOOH (lipid soluble) ⇄ RCOO– + H+ (trapped form)
	- Weak basic drugs (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants, amphetamines) are trapped in an acidic environment
		- Overdoses with these drugs can be treated via acidification of urine (ammonium chloride)
		- RNH<sub>3</sub>+ (trapped form) ⇄ RNH2 + H+ (lipid soluble)
		- The elimination of tricyclic antidepressants, which are basic, can be increased by acidification of urine, but toxicity is generally treated with sodium bicarbonate. 
- Neutral substances can be reabsorbed.
# Biliary elimination 
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Lipophilic</span> and hydrophilic substances 
- Lipophilic substances that have undergone biliary elimination may be reabsorbed from the gut and then secreted again in bile (enterohepatic circulation) 
# Pulmonary elimination: primarily in inhaled anesthetic drugs
# Changes in advanced age
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↓ Tubular secretion and ↓ GFR → ↑ concentrations of drugs that are eliminated renally</span>
- Consequently, lower therapeutic doses should be considered in elderly individuals.
