- Definition: the energy used to overcome elastic recoil and airway resistance by the respiratory muscles for respiration (expressed in J/L)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Elastic recoil</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Increases with ↑ inspiratory volume</span> 
	- Influenced by, e.g., pulmonary airway elasticity and surface tension of alveoli
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Airway resistance</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Increases with ↑ lung compression (e.g., due to ↑ intraabdominal pressure, pleural disease, mediastinal mass), ↑ flow rate (e.g., due to ↑ respiratory rate with increased turbulence), and ↓ airway diameter (e.g., due to bronchospasm)</span>
	- Influenced by, e.g., tissue resistance (e.g., chest wall/lung resistance) and airway resistance
- Regulation 
	- Optimization of respiratory rate (RR)
		- ↑ RR → ↓ elastic WOB
		- ↓ RR → ↓ resistive WOB
	- Optimization of tidal volume (VT)
		- ↑ VT → ↓ resistive WOB
		- ↓ VT → ↑ resistive WOB
- Changes in WOB due to respiratory condition
