- Etiology
	- Congenital![[../img/Pasted image 20240207154742.png|Pasted image 20240207154742.png]]
		- Intrinsic: malformation of the smooth muscle of a ureteral segment and consecutive impairment of peristalsis (functional stenosis)
		- Extrinsic: aberrant renal pole artery causing proximal ureteral obstruction
	- Acquired: factors causing ureteral obstruction
- Clinical features
	- Newborns and infants
		- Palpable upper abdominal mass
		- Failure to thrive
		- Recurrent [[./Pyelonephritis|pyelonephritis]]
	- Children and adults
		- Flank pain or upper abdominal pain that may be triggered or worsened during states of increased diuresis (e.g., after caffeine or alcohol consumption).
		- Nausea/vomiting
		- Recurrent [[./Pyelonephritis|pyelonephritis]]
		- Hematuria
- Diagnostics
	- Ultrasound
		- In industrialized countries, most cases of congenital ureteropelvic junction obstruction are <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">diagnosed antenatally with hydronephrosis on prenatal ultrasound.</span>
	- IV urography
- Treatment
	- Observation: asymptomatic, mild cases
	- Surgery
		- Symptomatic patients or those with > 40% loss of renal function
