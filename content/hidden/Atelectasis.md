# Etiology
- Obstructive atelectasis (most common): airway obstruction (e.g., by a foreign body, mucus plug, malignancy) → nonventilated alveoli → reabsorption of gas in the poststenotic space → lung collapse 
- Nonobstructive atelectasis
	- Compression atelectasis: external space-occupying lesion (e.g., [[./Pleural effusion|pleural effusion]]) that compresses the lung → forcefully pushes air out of the alveoli
	- Adhesive atelectasis: surfactant deficiency or dysfunction → increases surface tension of alveoli → instability and collapse (e.g., [[./Acute respiratory distress syndrome|acute respiratory distress syndrome]] ([[./Acute respiratory distress syndrome|ARDS]]) in adults, [[./Neonatal respiratory distress syndrome|neonatal respiratory distress syndrome]] in premature infants)
	- Cicatrization (contraction) atelectasis: parenchymal scarring that leads to contraction of the lung (due to chronic destructive lung processes such as tuberculosis, [[./Sarcoidosis|sarcoidosis]], and fibrosis, e.g., secondary to radiation therapy)
	- Relaxation atelectasis: loss of contact between parietal and visceral tissue (e.g., pneumothorax, [[./Pleural effusion|pleural effusion]])
 - <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Postoperative atelectasis: one of the most common post-operative complications (especially after chest or abdominal surgery); often occurs within 72 hours of surgery</span>
	 - Atelectasis is often <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">precipitated by postoperative pain (poor cough) and poor lung compliance, retained airway secretions, posterior tongue prolapse, airway edema, or anesthetic effects</span>, which can all interfere with spontaneous deep breathing and coughing.

# Pathophysiology


---
# Clinical features
- Symptoms depend on the acuity and extent of atelectasis.
	- Large number of affected alveoli or rapid onset → acute dyspnea, chest pain, tachypnea, tachycardia, and cyanosis
- Dull percussion note, diminished breath sounds, and decreased fremitus over the affected lung
- Possibly tracheal deviation towards the side of lesion
