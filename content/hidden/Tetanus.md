- Tetanospasmin: reaches the CNS through retrograde axonal transport
	- Toxin binds to receptors of peripheral nerves and is then transported to interneurons (Renshaw cells) in the CNS via vesicles. 
	- Acts as protease that cleaves synaptobrevin, a SNARE protein → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">prevention of inhibitory neurotransmitters (i.e., [[./Neurotransmitters|GABA]] and glycine) release from Renshaw cells in the spinal cord</span> → uninhibited activation of alpha motor neurons → muscle spasms, rigidity, and autonomic instability
- Tetanolysin: causes hemolysis and has cardiotoxic effects
