# Epidemiology

- Bacterial (pyogenic lung abscess)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Most commonly caused by anaerobic bacteria that colonize the oral cavity (e.g., Peptostreptococcus spp., Prevotella spp., Bacteroides spp., Fusobacterium spp.)</span>
	- Less commonly caused by aerobic bacteria, such as: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[./Staphylococcus aureus|Staphylococcus aureus]]</span>
		- The most virulent strains of S aureus have been infected with a bacteriophage that transmits genes for <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL), a cytotoxin that destroys leukocytes and causes tissue necrosis.</span>  PVL is primarily seen in community-acquired strains of S aureus that are methicillin-resistant (methicillin-resistance is conferred by a different mobile genetic element mecA).
