- Definition: disease of the retina with abnormal vessel proliferations that affects preterm infants
- Pathophysiology: elevated and fluctuating partial pressures of oxygen → pathological extraretinal neovascularization → hemorrhages, formation of fibrovascular membranes, and, in severe cases, retinal detachment 
	- This neovascularization, however, does not supply the retina as it normally would, but instead inappropriately infiltrates the vitreous body and other preretinal regions.
- Etiology
	- Premature birth
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Ventilation or oxygen administration</span>
	- Birth weight < 1500 g
