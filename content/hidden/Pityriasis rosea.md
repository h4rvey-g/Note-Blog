- Prodrome (1–2 weeks prior to rash onset): flu-like symptoms (e.g., malaise, fever, pharyngitis)
- Initial eruption (∼ 90% of cases): <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">herald patch (mother patch)</span> 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Herald/mother = followed days later by other scaly erythematous plaques</span>
	- Single ovoid macule or patch, 2–10 cm in diameter ![[../img/Pasted image 20240610145604.png|Pasted image 20240610145604.png]]
	- Slightly raised, dark red border with a central salmon-colored clearing zone
	- Surrounded by a collarette: a collar of fine, white scales (like cigarette paper) 
	- Typically on the back 
- Secondary eruption (2–21 days later)
	- Bilateral diffuse, oval-shaped, salmon-colored papules and plaques (< 1.5 cm) with scaly collarette
	- Papules appear along Langer lines, which align on the back like the branches of a Christmas tree (<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Christmas tree appearance</span>) ![[../img/L85757.png|L85757.png]]
