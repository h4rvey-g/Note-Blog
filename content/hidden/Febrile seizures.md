<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Febrile seizures are seizures that are associated with fever (mainly temperatures exceeding 38°C (100.4°F) in the absence of CNS infection, metabolic abnormalities, or a history of afebrile seizures.</span>
# Epidemiology
- Peak incidence: 2nd year of life; <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">most commonly occurs between 6 months and 5 years of age</span>
- Prevalence: Febrile seizures occur in ∼ 4% of all children.

# Etiology
The exact pathophysiological mechanisms of febrile seizures are not known. Risk factors:
- Genetic predisposition 
- High fever (> 40°C (104°F))
- Viral infection (e.g., HHV-6, influenza) 
- Recent immunization

# Diagnostics
- Check signs of meningeal irritation to rule out meningitis.

---
# Treatment
Uncomplicated seizures usually resolve after a few minutes spontaneously. However, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">abortive therapy should be administered if seizures ≥ 5 min or complex.</span>
- Abortive therapy
	- Treatment of choice: IV lorazepam
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Reassure caregivers</span> and provide information 
	- Inform the caregivers that there is low risk of neurological damage or death after an initial febrile seizure.
- After a febrile seizure, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">initiate antipyretic therapy (NSAIDs and [[./Non-opioid analgesics|acetaminophen]]) at an early stage (temperatures from 38°C (100.4°F)) as they restore the central thermoregulatory setpoint back to normal by reducing the synthesis of prostaglandin E2.</span>
