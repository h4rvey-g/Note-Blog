# Epidemiology

# Etiology
- Inherited susceptibility: primarily autosomal dominant with reduced penetrance
	- ∼ 50% of cases: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">associated with a mutation in the ryanodine receptor type 1 (RYR-1)</span>
		- RYR1 primarily in skeletal myocytes, RYR2 primarily in cardiac myocytes, and RYR3 in various cells including neurons.
- Triggering agents
	- Volatile [[./Inhalational anesthetics|anesthetics]] (except nitrous oxide)
	- Succinylcholine

# Pathophysiology
- Administration of triggering substances → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">calcium release from intracellular compartments or delay in its reuptake → ↑ calcium in muscle cells → ↑ contractility of the skeletal muscle → ↑ metabolism → ↑ oxygen consumption in addition to ↑ CO<sub>2</sub> production, heat, and lactate (malignant hyperthermia) → mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis → uncoupled oxidative phosphorylation → breakdown of the cell's energy supply → cell death</span>
>[!tip] 
>Smooth muscle and cardiac muscle remain unaffected.

# Treatment
- Discontinuation of potential triggering agents 
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Immediate administration of dantrolene (ryanodine receptor antagonist)</span>
	- Mechanism of action
		- Ryanodine receptor antagonist
		- Prevents release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum of striated muscle → reduced muscle rigidity and hyperthermia
