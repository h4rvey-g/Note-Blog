- Definition: painless accumulation of fluid in a sac around one or both testicles which derives from the tunica vaginalis, a tissue covering the testes
- Etiology
	- Idiopathic (most common)
	- Congenital hydrocele
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Communicating hydrocele</span>
			- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Occurs due to the failed closure of the processus vaginalis during development </span>
			- Intestinal organs may also protrude through the processus and form an <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[./Inguinal hernia|inguinal hernia]]</span>. 
			- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Communicating hydroceles increase in size with the [[./Vagal maneuver|Valsalva maneuver]] and are reducible.</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Noncommunicating hydrocele: no connection to the peritoneal cavity present </span>
			- Due to extensive secretion and/or reduced reabsorption of fluid.
			- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">This type of hydrocele is not affected by the [[./Vagal maneuver|Valsalva maneuver]] and not reducible.</span>
	- Acquired hydrocele
		- Secondary to underlying pathology (e.g., trauma, tumor, torsion, infection)
- Clinical features
	- Fluctuant, painless swelling of affected scrotum
	- Positive transillumination
