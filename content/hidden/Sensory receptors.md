- **Pacinian.** Pace = **vibration**. I imagine a running coach giving me **pressure** by saying "keep up the pace!" as I'm running **fast.**
- **Ruffini**. Sounds like an Italian noodle. I imagine an Italian playing with a **stretch**y noodle after eating a large pasta meal, so now he is **slow.**
- **Meiss.** Mess. I imagine my mother telling me in a **light** yet threatening voice to clean up my mess **fast.**
- **Merkel.** Steve "Urkel" is **sensitive** but a little **slow.** He's also skinny/**light**. I imagine touching his acne would be **bumpy**.
- Also, the **M's** are superficial in the skin, while **R**uffini and **P**acinian are deep in the dermis. The shape of an M is wavy like the dermal papillae.
