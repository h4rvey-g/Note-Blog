Condition in which the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">fetal vessels are located in the membranes near the internal os of the cervix</span>, putting them at risk of injury if the membranes rupture
# Epidemiology
---

# Etiology
---
- Placental anomalies, such as:
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Velamentous umbilical cord insertion </span>![[../img/Pasted image 20240312161339.png|Pasted image 20240312161339.png]]
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Inserts in chorioamniotic membrane rather than placenta â†’ fetal vessels travel to placenta unprotected by Wharton jelly</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Bilobate or succenturiate placenta</span>
		- Variation of the placental morphology with one or more accessory lobes developing separately from the main placental body

# Clinical features
---
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Painless vaginal bleeding (fetal blood) that occurs suddenly after rupture of membranes</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Fetal distress (e.g., fetal bradycardia</span>; decelerations or sinusoidal pattern on fetal heart tracings)
- Fetal death can occur quickly through exsanguination or asphyxiation if fetal vessels are compressed during labor.
