# Confidentiality
- The patient may waive the right to confidentiality
- If the patient loses capacity, health information should be disclosed according to the patient's best interest
- Health care providers should make their best efforts to ensure the safety of patient information (e.g., patient information should not be discussed in public areas, even within the hospital setting)
## Exceptions to confidentiality
- Suspected child, disabled person, or elder abuse (reporting laws for spousal abuse vary by state)
- Knife or gunshot wounds
- Diagnosis of a reportable communicable disease
	- In most states, the physician does not have the right to inform third parties without the patient's consent.
- Threats to harm self or others and reasonable ability to carry out the threat in the near future
