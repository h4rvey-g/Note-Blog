- Hemorrhage control
	- Uterotonic agents
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">IV oxytocin (diluted in saline)</span>
		- IM methylergonovine: if no hypertension or arterial disease is present
			- Ergot alkaloid agent
			- Increases frequency and amplitude of uterine contractions, which shortens labor and reduces blood loss
			- Contraindications include pre-existing hypertension and preeclampsia
		- Prostaglandins such as misoprostol: useful when injectable uterotonic agents are unavailable or contraindicated (can also be given intracavitary)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Tranexamic acid</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Given concomitantly with uterotonic agents</span>
