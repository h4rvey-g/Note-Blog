# Radiation injury
High doses of ionizing radiation (e.g., radiotherapy, nuclear accidents) cause DNA and cellular damage via reactive oxygen species and photons or particles, which cause inflammation and progressive tissue damage. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Certain rapidly regenerating tissues (e.g., skin, gastrointestinal tissue, bone marrow) are more susceptible due to the depletion of immature parenchymal stem cells.</span> Cancerous cells are more susceptible to radiation than healthy cells due to their high replication rates and dysfunctional DNA repair mechanisms.
Easily affected cells:
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">GI: Intestinal crypt stem cells</span>
- Bone marrow: hematopoietic progenitors (pancytopenia)
- Gonads: spermatogonia (infertility)
- Skin: basal keratinocytes, hair follicle stem cells (desquamation, hair loss)
## Acute radiation syndrome
### <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Skin and mucosa (these are rapidly regenerating tissues)</span>
- Erythema, desquamation, blisters, ulcers, necrosis
- Stomatitis, dysphagia
- Cataracts
- Hair loss
### Respiratory![[../img/L60758.jpg|L60758.jpg]]
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Early radiation-induced lung injury: radiation pneumonitis</span>
	- Usually develops within<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)"> 3–12 weeks of radiation</span>
	- Caused by an acute release of proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-1, IL-6) 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Common symptoms: dyspnea, dry cough, hemoptysis, and fever (patients may be asymptomatic)</span>
	- Partial respiratory insufficiency is an early sign.
## Chronic radiation injury

### Respiratory
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Late radiation-induced lung injury: radiation fibrosis</span>
	- Usually develops after <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">6–12 months of radiation</span>
