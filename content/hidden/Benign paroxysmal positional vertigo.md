# Pathophysiology
Although incompletely understood, BPPV is thought to occur <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">due to dislodged or abnormally adherent otoconia</span>, causing <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">semicircular canal dysfunction</span>.
- Otoconia (otoliths): physiological calcium carbonate crystals present within the utricle and saccule that serve to maintain balance and spatial orientation
- Canalithiasis
	- Dislodged, free-floating otoconia (endolymphatic debris).

# Clinical features
- Episodic vertigo (spinning sensation)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Sudden (“paroxysmal”) and recurrent episodes</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Lasts several seconds (typically ≤ 1 minute)</span>
	- Triggered by certain head movements (positional vertigo) after a latency of a few seconds.
	- Associated with:
		- [[./Internuclear ophthalmoplegia|Nystagmus]] 
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Triggers: Quick rotation of the head relative to gravity is the main trigger of BPPV</span>
>[!tip] 
><span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">BPPV does not typically cause cochlear (e.g., [[./Hearing loss|hearing loss]] or tinnitus) or neurological symptoms.</span>
